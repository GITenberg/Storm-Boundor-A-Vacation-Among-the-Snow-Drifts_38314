By Capt. Alan Douglas, Scout-master<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>


<div class='unindent'><b><span class='big'>The Campfires of the Wolf Patrol</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Their first camping experience affords the scouts splendid opportunities to use
their recently acquired knowledge in a practical way. Elmer <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Chenoweth'">Chenowith</ins>, a lad
from the northwest woods, astonishes everyone by his familiarity with camp
life. A clean, wholesome story every boy should read.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Woodcraft; or, How a Patrol Leader Made Good</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This tale presents many stirring situations in which the boys are called upon to
exercise ingenuity and unselfishness. A story filled with healthful excitement.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Pathfinder; or, The Missing Tenderfoot</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some mysteries are cleared up in a most unexpected way, greatly to the credit
of our young friends. A variety of incidents follow fast, one after the other.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Fast Nine; or, a Challenge from Fairfield</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They show the same team-work here as when in camp. The description of the
final game with the team of a rival town, and the outcome thereof, form a stirring
narrative. One of the best baseball stories of recent years.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Great Hike; or, The Pride of The Khaki Troop</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After weeks of preparation the scouts start out on their greatest undertaking.
Their march takes them far from home, and the good-natured rivalry of the
different patrols furnishes many interesting and amusing situations.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Endurance Test; or, How Clear Grit Won the Day</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Few stories "get" us more than illustrations of pluck in the face of apparent
failure. Our heroes show the stuff they are made of and surprise their most ardent
admirers. One of the best stories Captain Douglas has written.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Under Canvas; or, The Hunt for the Cartaret Ghost</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was hard to disbelieve the evidence of their eyes but the boys by the
exercise of common-sense solved a mystery which had long puzzled older heads.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><b><br /><span class='big'>Storm-bound; or, a Vacation Among the Snow Drifts</span></b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The boys start out on the wrong track, but their scout training comes to the
rescue and their experience proves beneficial to all concerned.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE WRONG TRACK</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Elmer</span>, do you believe we're really on the
right track, or have we lost our bearings in this
everlasting snow forest?"</p>

<p>"Ask me something easy, please, Lil Artha!"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't like the looks of that sassy kid
who was so eager to have you make a map from
what he told us."</p>

<p>"Struck me he grinned too much, boys, as sure
as my name's George Robbins. I'm beginning to
smell a rat, and think he played a low-down trick
on us."</p>

<p>"That is, George, you mean he purposely gave
us the wrong directions, and that instead of heading
straight for the winter cabin of Toby's jolly
Uncle Caleb we're away off our base?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it to me, that's all I've got to say,"
muttered the boy who had called himself George,
at the same time glancing apprehensively at the
snow-clad woods surrounding them on all sides.</p>

<p>"Me too!" added the fourth member of the little
heavily-laden party, and whose good-natured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
face usually screwed itself up in an odd series
of wrinkles whenever he spoke with such an effort.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the boy called Elmer, whose
last name was Chenowith, and upon whose decisions
the others seemed to depend considerably,
as though he might be a leader among them;
"let's rest up a bit here, and look the matter
squarely in the face. Perhaps we can figure out
where we've gone wrong, and start on a new
course."</p>

<p>These four well-grown lads were all dressed in
the well-known khaki suits that designate Boy
Scouts the wide world over. Of course they wore
heavy woolen sweaters in addition, for the time
was just after Christmas, and Old Winter had
taken a notion to set in unusually early that year.</p>

<p>They belonged to the Hickory Ridge Troop of
Boy Scouts, which lively town was situated many
miles to the south of the place where we discover
the quartette up against a puzzling question.</p>

<p>Toby Jones had an old uncle who was not only
a scientific man, but who loved the Great Outdoors
so much that of late he had come to spend most
of his time at his lonely cabin in the forest. Here
in the summer he studied, and experimented to
his heart's content; while during the winter he
set traps, and took wonderful photographs of the
snowbound woods, as well as of the fur-bearing
little animals that made their homes there.</p>

<p>The idea had struck Toby that with some of his
best chums he surprise this jolly Uncle Caleb, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was a well-known professor among scientists.
Many times the boy had received a warm invitation
to run up and visit the old gentleman, as well
as fetch a friend or two along, but until this winter
Toby had somehow never entertained the idea
of doing so.</p>

<p>Once it took hold of him, and he became wildly
enthusiastic over it. When he mentioned the
scheme to Elmer, as well as two other scouts, they
fell in with it so quickly that the plans were soon
arranged.</p>

<p>Accordingly, immediately after Christmas the
four lads had taken a train for the north, and
about noon dropped off at a lonely station, where
the operator was a new hand, and had never
even heard of Uncle Caleb, so that the boys hardly
knew which way to turn. Just then they happened
to run across a lanky boy with a grinning
face, whom Elmer "pumped," with the result that
they were directed to follow certain landmarks,
turn ever so many times until they came to a
frozen creek, up which if they headed a mile they
would discover the cabin they sought.</p>

<p>They had been following that same frozen
stream more than two hours, and there was not
the slightest sign of anything in the way of a
shack or cabin. In fact, it looked as though they
had managed to tramp into the very heart of what
seemed to be a trackless forest. In every direction
stretched that never ending array of tall and
little trees, each snow splashed; for there were
several inches of the white feathery covering on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the ground, what Elmer called fine "tracking
snow;" if only they had been hunting game instead
of a shelter.</p>

<p>Though all of the scouts kept constantly on the
alert they had failed to detect the first sign of
human presence. Not a shout or a gunshot had
they heard; in vain had they searched the snowy
ground for the welcome trail of a trapper going
to or coming home after visiting his line of snares.</p>

<p>No wonder then that some of the boys had
begun to believe they were tricked by that glib-tongued
native lad, who had chuckled so disagreeably
as he accepted the silver quarter Elmer
thrust in his grimy palm.</p>

<p>All of them bore heavy loads. For the most
part these consisted of extra clothes of course
for use in case of extreme cold weather; but
two of them also carried guns; and Toby had
strapped on his pack a pair of snow-shoes his
uncle had once presented to him, but which the
boy had never found a good chance to use, though
he hoped the time had now arrived for putting
them to some service.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to figure things out," Elmer
told them, as they sat down on a log to rest, while
trying to decide which way they should turn;
"and while I'm liable to be mistaken just as
much as anybody else, I really think we'd have a
better chance to find that cabin, or run across
some sign of Toby's uncle, if we quit following
this creek bed, and turned sharply to the right."</p>

<p>Now Elmer was not only the leader of the Wolf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Patrol when at home, but had long ago qualified
for the position of assistant scout master of the
troop. When the regular scout master, a young
man named Mr. Roderic Garrabrant, chanced to
be absent, which frequently happened, the boys
looked to Elmer to guide and direct them.</p>

<p>Consequently the three who were now in his
company had come to look for great things from
their chum; and Elmer often found it a difficult
task to satisfy their expectations. And so it was
he had in the start given them to understand that
he could make mistakes as well as the next one,
and they must not think him infallible.</p>

<p>As usual everybody seemed ready to fall in
with his suggestion but George, who had a contrary
streak in his make-up, and was always
ready with objections and questions and serious
shakings of the head. They called him "Doubting
George," but grown people would long ago
have dubbed him a pessimist, because he was
always seeing the gloomy side of things, and
wanting to be doubly convinced.</p>

<p>"But it seems to me," he started to say, "that
we may be jumping out of the fryingpan into the
fire if we do that. How do we know the cabin
lies to the right?"</p>

<p>"We don't," replied Elmer, without manifesting
any feeling over his opinion being questioned,
for he knew George of old, and in fact would have
been considerably surprised if the other had not
put up what Toby called a "kick."</p>

<p>"Would you like to direct us, George?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the tall scout, whose name was Arthur Stansbury,
but whom his schoolmates had in a spirit of
fun long ago dubbed "Lil Artha," which ridiculous
nick-name clung to him like a leech to this
day, although he was fully a head above any of
the other fellows.</p>

<p>"Oh! excuse me from taking that responsibility
on my shoulders," George hastened to say, looking
almost alarmed; "if I did, and happened to
guess wrong, I'd never hear the end of it."</p>

<p>"So you admit that it'd have to be a <i>guess</i>, do
you?" pursued Lil Artha mercilessly; "well, on
the part of Elmer he's tried to reason the old
thing out, and both Toby'n me feel that we can't
do better than try what he says. I only hope the
walking's better than it's been along this frozen
creek, where the ice is too slippery for us to make
use of the same. Why didn't we think to fetch
our skates along?"</p>

<p>"I did think of it," Toby told him; "but it
meant more weight to our packs; and then from
what Uncle Caleb's told me about the lay of the
country up here, I couldn't figure out how we'd
find any use for skates where there was only
swamp, marsh, and mebbe a few little crooked
creeks nearly always covered with a foot of snow.
So I fetched these bully snow-shoes instead.
Don't I hope I'll have a chance to skim over the
snow on the same, if we're lucky enough to get a
heavy fall while up here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may get a storm before we're
ready for it," observed Elmer drily, as he shot a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dubious glance up at the gray sky that had such
an ominous look.</p>

<p>Lil Artha jumped to his feet, showing signs of
some excitement.</p>

<p>"Hey! let's be on the hike, fellows!" he exclaimed;
"if a storm dropped on top of us right
now it wouldn't do a thing to us, p'raps. We
haven't got only enough grub for a single day. I
guess matches are about the only thing we're
heavy on, because we expected to eat our meals in
Uncle Caleb's cabin most of the time."</p>

<p>"Well, matches are good things to have up here
in the snow woods," remarked Elmer, who was an
exact contrast to George in that he always saw the
silver lining of the cloud, whereas the other scout
could not get beyond the pall.</p>

<p>"You bet they are," Lil Artha went on to say,
as he shouldered his pack, which he had arranged
in regular Adirondack fashion, with a band across
his forehead to assist in sustaining the weight;
"though for that matter, if we went shy of the
same I reckon you could depend on me to get fire
by making a little bow, and sawing the same on a
pointed stick, South Sea Islander way. I've done
it more'n once, though I never seem able to depend
on my cunning. Something goes wrong so often;
or else I'm in too big a hurry, and spoil everything.
But if you're ready lead off, Elmer.
We'll trip along in your tracks, and keep it up
for another hour anyway. That rest did us all a
heap of good."</p>

<p>The four scouts kept pushing on steadily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Elmer in the van continued to maintain a bright
lookout for any sign of footprints in the snow that
would give them encouragement, though as time
passed, and he failed to find any such, the rosy
hopes with which they had started began to gradually
fade away.</p>

<p>Of course the others also kept their eyes about
them, in hopes of sighting a lone cabin, or discovering
smoke rising amidst the trees. Hope
died hard, and only George grumbled when more
than half an hour had crept on without their running
upon the first sign that would mean success.</p>

<p>Once Elmer had pointed out to them the tracks
of a fox, and of course being true scouts, they
were all greatly interested in examining the trail,
and speculating on whether it had been of the
ordinary red variety, or a gray animal, perhaps
one of those silver-black foxes, the pelt of which
is often valued at as much as fifteen hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>Elmer had settled this question by picking up a
hair he found caught on the split end of a branch
that grew low down, and which the body of the
fox, as well as his brushy tail, must have scraped
as he slipped past. It was plainly a red hair, and
even George could not find any cause for disputing
that evidence, though he was far from happy,
and in a fit mood for argument if the occasion
arose.</p>

<p>Several other times Elmer pointed to the unmistakable
track of a bounding rabbit, and had
they had more time at their disposal the boys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would have liked nothing better than to follow
these, so as to figure out what was chasing bunny
to induce him to take such enormous jumps.
But the fact of their being astray in that unknown
forest, with night not far away, and a heavy snow-storm
brooding over them, rather discouraged
them from turning aside from the main thing that
engaged their attention, which of course was the
finding of the trapper's cabin.</p>

<p>Nobody paid the least attention to George when
they heard him grunting away in the rear, because
George would not have been happy unless he was
miserable, strange though that may sound. There
is generally a boy built after that fashion in every
crowd of scouts. As a rule he has some good
qualities that make his friends forgive his bad
ones, and finally they get so accustomed to his
grumblings that they pay little attention to them.
In fact George's complainings had little more
effect on his boon companions than so much
water poured on a duck's back would. It amused
him to grunt and object, and hurt them very little,
so what was the sense of making any trouble?</p>

<p>Another fifteen minutes crept along. There did
not seem to be any particular change in things,
except that the light was showing signs of failing,
and perhaps George stumbled more frequently,
for he was not as spry on his feet when carrying
a pack as the other fellows.</p>

<p>"Don't seem to be over this way either,
Elmer," suggested Lil Artha, finally.</p>

<p>"That's right, Uncle Caleb's cabin appears to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be as hard to locate as a needle in a haystack,"
admitted the leader of the Wolf Patrol, cheerily;
as though it would have to be something more than
this to discourage him, because he had made it
his business in life to always look at the bright
side of things; and knew that no matter how
gloomy the prospect might be it could seem much
worse.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" came abruptly from George
in the rear.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you back there;
stubbed your toe again? We'll have to make a
scout litter and carry you the rest of the way, if
you keep on falling over every old log there is,"
Lil Artha told him, severely.</p>

<p>"'Tain't that this time, mind you," the delinquent
one answered back, with a triumphant grin;
"but what's the use trying to poke along any
further? Might as well be killed for a sheep as a
lamb, any day. This place looks like it'd make a
good camp for to-night."</p>

<p>"Camp?" echoed Toby.</p>

<p>"Sure thing!" snapped George. "We're all
tuckered out, and as hungry as wolves in the dead
of winter; night's comin' on right fast; and then
if you take a look you'll see that it's begun to
snow!" and as the others did glance hastily up
they discovered the first few big flakes commence
to sail lazily down!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A STRANGE PLACE TO CAMP</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I'm</span> surprised at you saying it's going to snow,
George," Lil Artha remarked, as he turned on the
doubting scout; "because it'd be more like you to
tell us ten flakes didn't make a storm, and that
anyway there was always a chance of it giving us
the go-by. Guess you're tired, and want to snuggle
down close to a warm fire, which would explain
why you give in so easy-like."</p>

<p>"Just as you please, so long as we do camp,"
replied the other, as he began to undo the straps
that secured his hamper to his back.</p>

<p>"Keep still, fellows!" said Elmer, in a husky
whisper; "I honestly believe I saw a bevy of
partridges fly up in a tree over yonder," and as
he dropped his pack lightly to the ground, he
gripped the trusty little twelve-bore Marlin
double-barreled shot-gun which he had owned for
a number of years, and occasionally found a use
for.</p>

<p>"Oh! partridges, fat partridges, and me as
hungry as a bear!" gasped Toby; but Elmer had
already quitted his chums, and was making his
way toward the point he had indicated with his
hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>They watched him with considerable eagerness,
and waited to see what luck attended his stalking
action.</p>

<p>"Since it looks like we'd have to spend a night
here, like the Babes in the Wood," Lil Artha was
saying in a whisper, "it'd be real nice if Elmer
could only bag four plump birds for our supper!
Let's hope he gets a string of the same in range,
and makes a double with each shot."</p>

<p>"Honest Injun! I think I could devour four myself,
without half trying," Toby assured them,
rubbing the pit of his stomach as though to call
their attention to the fact that it was an aching
void.</p>

<p>"Huh! you mightn't even get the smell of a
single one cooking," George warned him; "because
I've been told partridges are wary old birds,
even up here, where they light in the trees after
being flushed, instead of going off with a whirr of
their wings, like they do down our way."</p>

<p>"There, he's going to let drive!" said Lil
Artha, who, being something of a hunter himself,
had been closely observing the progress of Elmer
all this time.</p>

<p>"Good luck to his pot-shot!" muttered Toby.</p>

<p>Two reports were heard in quick succession.
Then Elmer was seen to hastily run forward, at
the same time managing to reload his gun.</p>

<p>"He got one, anyhow!" cried Toby, exultantly;
"that fixes <i>me</i> all right. There, he has grabbed
another up off the ground. Bully for Elmer! He
knows how to work the game, all right. What!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
another bird? Oh! George, if only he had killed
four you might have had one, the same as the rest
of us!"</p>

<p>"Well, I like your nerve," said George, indignantly;
"why should I be singled out to get left,
tell me that, Toby?"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, George, and don't get riled so
easy," Lil Artha told him, "because, as sure as
you live he's hurrying over to pick a fourth bird
up. What d'ye think of that for great luck, now?
Four hungry scouts, and a fat partridge for each.
I think it's a splendid introduction to Uncle
Caleb's pet game preserve, don't you all?"</p>

<p>"He must have knocked over three with that
right barrel," ventured Toby; "like as not they
were all sitting along a limb when he fired, and
then he picked that last one when they were on the
wing, remembering that George would have to go
hungry, or only suck the racks, if he didn't get
another."</p>

<p>When Elmer rejoined them he was wearing a
smile of contentment such as usually adorns the
face of a successful sportsman.</p>

<p>"Couldn't have been better any way you fixed
it, fellows," he told them. "There they sat, in a
row, and you never saw a prettier sight. I just
hated to do such a thing, but even scouts can be
forgiven for shooting game when they're adrift
in an unknown snow forest, and hungry in the
bargain."</p>

<p>"I should say they could," Lil Artha added,
forcibly, "and lots of other times in the bargain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
But these birds are as plump as any I've ever
seen. Just feel of the fat breasts, will you?
Makes my mouth water, thinking how fine they'll
go with our coffee and crackers. How fortunate
we thought to bring a few things along in case
Uncle Caleb might run short on rations. Plenty
of coffee, a little tea, some sugar, a can of condensed
milk, crackers, cheese, a pound of bacon,
and a package of self-raising flour for flapjacks.
We ought to subsist for a whole day on that bill of
fare, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"And as we've got our guns along," interposed
Lil Artha, "with more or less of game around us,
what's the use of worrying? For one I'm meaning
to take things as they come, and squeeze what
fun I can out of the same."</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" said Toby, and Elmer nodded
his approval; only skeptical George remained
silent, for he was feeling of his partridge and
with a frown on his brow that made Toby hasten
to assure him the bird was a real one, and not
such as he may have seen in his dreams.</p>

<p>Already Elmer was casting about to see where
they had better locate their camp. It was easy
to say this would be for only one night, but how
did they know? The threatening storm might
swoop down with such force that it would virtually
imprison them for a much longer stay. And
so he considered it worth while to do the best
possible while they had any choice of situation.</p>

<p>Elmer had had considerable experience, having
spent a year up on a Canadian cattle ranch and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wheat farm owned by an uncle, Elmer's father
having been given charge of the property. There
the boy had learned dozens of things that were
apt to prove valuable to any one in the woods.
Besides, he had made it a practice to pick up
information wherever he went by asking questions,
investigating for himself, and constantly increasing
his stock of knowledge.</p>

<p>Looking in every quarter he presently decided
that since they carried no tent, and it would be no
easy task to make a brush shelter, their best move
was to settle down in the lee of one of those cavities
formed when a hurricane had toppled a number
of giant trees over, with their roots, and the
earth attached to the same, standing fully eight
feet in the air.</p>

<p>There was a little choice about the matter, and
Elmer picked out the one best suited to screen
them from the northwest wind. The snow would
surely come from that direction, and having a
windbreak might mean considerable.</p>

<p>"Drop everything here, boys, and let's hustle
to collect all the wood we can find. Don't stop
short of darkness, because maybe we'll have to
keep a fire going for several days. Just drag it
handy, so we'll know where to find it, even if the
snow comes two feet deep!"</p>

<p>"Whew! I sure hope it don't get us that way
to start with," said Toby; "and us not knowing
whether Uncle Caleb's shack is to the north, east
or west. Don't I wish we'd run across him in the
woods, and were toasting our shins alongside a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fire in his comfy little place right now! Um!
But the snow's coming faster than she was, fellows!"</p>

<p>"The more reason we should get busy," Elmer
told him.</p>

<p>At that they started energetically to "make hay
while the sun shone," as Lil Artha said, though
he must himself have been convinced that the comparison
was hardly a good one, judging from the
grimace he gave when casting his eyes upward
toward the leaden sky that frowned down upon
them like a dome.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no lack of wood handy.
This had doubtless been one reason why Elmer
had decided on pitching the camp where he did.
Those fallen trees had in crashing to the ground
broken many large limbs off, and all that was
necessary for the campers to do was to drag these,
one after another, to a convenient striking distance
from the hole in which they intended spending
the night.</p>

<p>All around it they banked up the loose wood,
until Toby declared they had fully enough to do
an army.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it," said Lil Artha, an
authority on fires among his fellow scouts; "you'd
be s'prised to see what an enormous amount of
wood a fire eats up in a single night; and like as
not we may have to hold the fort a week, just as
Elmer said. Keep on fetching it a little while
longer, boys."</p>

<p>"You're on the safe side there, Lil Artha," the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cautious scout master decided; "we can't have too
much burning wood, with that sky threatening us.
And to run out, with the snow piled up hip-high
over everything wouldn't be the nicest job in the
world. Let's work at it for another ten minutes.
By then it will be so near dark that we can lay
off, and get our camp fixed."</p>

<p>So they labored on industriously until Elmer
called a halt. George was a good enough worker,
and usually did his share when the necessity
arose. His grumbling really sprang more from
force of habit than a desire to make himself
disagreeable. Sometimes Elmer seriously considered
whether it would pay them to try and cure
George of his fault-finding, and then as often decided
that, given time, it must surely die out.
Things of that sort generally thrive on opposition.</p>

<p>To Lil Artha was given over the task of making
the fire. It was lucky indeed in this pinch that
Elmer had thought to bring his pet camp hatchet
along. Though its weight had added to his weariness
on the march, he had had what he called a
"hunch" that it might come in handy, though
hardly expecting to be compelled to fall back on
the little tool the first thing in order to supply fuel
for a camp.</p>

<p>So the tall scout began to hack at a couple of
promising fragments of thick limbs which would
make good sides for the cooking fire, and upon
which their coffeepot could rest; for they had
such a thing along, as well as a skillet, both made
of aluminum, and weighing next to nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer, assisted by George and Toby, meanwhile
started to see how some sort of shelter could
be arranged with the four rubber ponchos which
they carried. He knew how soldiers on the march
are in the habit of fastening two of these together
by means of the grummet holes along the edges,
forming a little shelter called a "dog-tent," under
which the pair can at least keep the upper halves
of their bodies from the rain.</p>

<p>By skillful work they managed to cover the
cavity behind the upturned roots of the fallen forest
monarch in such a fashion that it would shed
most of the snow, even though some might drift
through the cracks.</p>

<p>"A pretty good job!" Lil Artha told them, as
he suspended operations in connection with his
fire, which was by now sending out a grateful
warmth, and much good cheer in addition.</p>

<p>"Next thing is to get the birds plucked, and
ready for the spit," announced Toby, as he took
up the one that had been apportioned to him.</p>

<p>George followed suit, but was evidently a poor
hand at stripping the feathers off, to judge by the
gingerly way he went at it. Lil Artha had to
show him just how to grip hold, and make things
fly; but even then George looked anything but
happy.</p>

<p>"And I'd feel safe in wagering," said Toby,
with a laugh, as he held up his partridge, beautifully
cleaned, and ready to be broiled before the
fire, after he had split it down the back, "that if
we were anywhere near home George would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
willing to spend his last dime in bribing some boy
to finish his job; but that don't go here; no work
no pay. Those who expect to dine on partridge
must prepare the same. You hear me speaking,
George. But I don't mind showing you again how
I do it, which according to my notion is a better
way than Lil Artha has."</p>

<p>And as George, seeing his opportunity, commenced
to compliment Toby, and engage his attention,
the result was that he got his partridge not
only completely denuded down to the last pinfeather,
but split along the back in the bargain.</p>

<p>After that a busy scene that glowing, snapping
fire saw, with the coffeepot sending out a delightful
aroma, and the four hungry boys each holding
out his game near the flames, turning it often in
order to allow every part to receive an equal share
of the intense heat that was browning the outside
so beautifully.</p>

<p>Finally Toby gave a groan.</p>

<p>"Can't stand for it any longer, and that's a
fact, fellows!" he announced; "please fill my cup
with coffee, Elmer, and let me get started or I'll
cave in. George, pass that package of crackers,
will you; and, Lil Artha, I'd like to sample that
cheese if you don't mind!"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake everybody wait on Toby,
and get him shut off, or he'll give us no peace!"
exclaimed Lil Artha, though he had already put
his own teeth into one half of his sizzling partridge,
to find that it was as tender as could be,
and perfectly delicious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>In another minute or two all of them were busily
engaged. It was such a pleasant duty, partaking
of this forest meal, and amidst such romantic
surroundings, that for the time being they
forgot all the dismal prospects ahead of them, and
were quite merry. Toby joked, and Lil Artha
laughed aloud, while Elmer joined them, and even
George, placated by having his gnawing pains
satisfied, for the time being looked contented with
the world. He would not have made any objection
had he been offered a second edition of that
game supper; for when his bird had been reduced
to a mere lot of well-picked bones his taste for
broiled partridge seemed as keen as ever.</p>

<p>Possessed of hearty boyish appetites it can
readily be understood that they had made a pretty
good hole in their limited supplies by the time all
of them admitted that they were satisfied. Toby
professed to be greatly concerned because of this
growing scarcity of rations, and as for George,
his gloom had returned, since he was already talking
of the time, near at hand most likely, when the
cupboard would be as bare as it was when Old
Mother Hubbard went to get her dog a bone.</p>

<p>"Gee! whiz! look at it coming down, would
you!" burst out Lil Artha, as having finished
attending to that clamorous appetite, he thought it
worth while to take an observation, in order to
learn what the weather might be.</p>

<p>"Never saw it snow harder," admitted Toby.</p>

<p>"Be over our heads by morning, see if 'tain't,"
George prophesied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, p'raps you may have a chance to use
those snow-shoes sooner'n you thought you would,
Toby," ventured Lil Artha, as they all crouched
there, staring out at the dark forest, and watching
the myriads of big flakes steadily falling, as
though a storm of the greatest magnitude had
come down from the far northwest, where the
weather man keeps this brand of thing in tap for
scouts who are incautious enough to be caught
napping, away off in a strange woods, and with
only rations for one day in their haversacks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LONG NIGHT</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Let</span> me tell you this is going to be the queerest
old camp any of us ever found ourselves stuck in,"
Toby ventured to remark, some time later.</p>

<p>"I should say it was," grumbled George, as he
rubbed his ears, and then held both hands out
toward the fire to warm them again.</p>

<p>"I know one thing we ought to do right away,"
said Elmer, "and that's get out those warm skating
tuques; they'll keep the air off our heads, and
can be drawn down to protect our ears."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea, Elmer," Lil Artha told
him, "because I don't want to have one of my
wigwags frozen off. You see, I'm so much taller
than the rest of you it takes harder work for my
poor heart to pump warm blood all the way up;
and so I'm likely to suffer from cold extremities.
Seems like that off ear is frosted right now."</p>

<p>"If it is," cried George, hurriedly, as though
he thought Lil Artha meant all he said, "take my
advice, and rub it hard with a lot of snow. That'll
take the frost out, and start circulation again.
Brr! but this is going to be a tough night, when
you think of it."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Elmer told him; "seems to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
we've got a whole lot to be thankful for, with this
fine fire, and a protection against the storm. Perhaps
we may run up against something harder
than this before we're done."</p>

<p>"But we haven't got a tent, and our grub is
pretty skimpy, say what you will," the grumbler
went on to protest.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all very true," continued Elmer,
"but how wise we were to fetch our blankets
along, for fear that Toby's uncle mightn't have
enough in stock to go around. They felt pretty
heavy when we carried them, soldier fashion,
around one shoulder, and tied them under the
other arm; but here's where they come in dandy."</p>

<p>"Well, believe me, it was the smartest trick we
ever did," Lil Artha hastened to comment, "and
if we'd only glimpsed this sort of box ahead, so
as to lay in three times as much grub, it'd be all
right."</p>

<p>"It is all right as it stands," the leader went on
to say, "and we'll show how scouts can take things
as they come, without making mouths. So let's
see how we're going to fix ourselves for the
night."</p>

<p>"Guess none of us care much to sit up late, and
gabble over the fire," suggested Toby; "though
it seems a fellow can't get enough of that heat in
him."</p>

<p>"I want to shut out the whole business," affirmed
George, in sheer disgust, "and I hope that
after my eyes close I won't know a blooming thing
till morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>George was a good sleeper as a rule, and his
troubles seldom kept him from getting a fair share
of rest. Nor was he like his cousin, Philander
Smith, also a member of the Wolf Patrol, and who
had been known to walk in his sleep; George, once
he snuggled down, with his blanket tucked all
around him, was like a regular Indian mummy.
The others, knowing this from past experiences,
paid little attention to his complaints concerning
a disturbed night, because they knew it never had
any real basis of fact.</p>

<p>For some little time the four boys busied themselves
getting "fixed." George was as hard to
suit as any old maid. He found something wrong
with every corner of the depression that he tried;
here it was a root that jabbed him in the ribs; in
another place the point of a big stone made it impossible
for him to curl up, and maintain a comfortable
attitude.</p>

<p>After he had made the complete round, the
others allowing him his choice, he was finally compelled
to accept the first position he had tested.</p>

<p>"Now let's hope we've heard the last kick from
you, George," Lil Artha told him, severely, after
submitting to all this fussing; "I don't see what
you've got to complain about after all. Your
bones are well covered with a pad, while mine stick
out like the joints of a scarecrow. And say, don't
you think I'm going to have a tough time of it
stowing these long legs of mine away? Chances
are they'll push out in the night, and when I wake
up again I'll find the lower part of poor Lil Artha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as stiff as a board. Subside, George! Give the
rest of us a chance to get settled down. If we all
took as long as you did it'd be near morning before
we fixed things."</p>

<p>Finally, however, they seemed to have made the
best of a bad bargain. Taking Elmer's advice
they all kept as close together as possible. In
this way perhaps they might not secure a great
abundance of decent sleep, but the fact of their
being in touch with each other would add to their
comfort in the way of warmth.</p>

<p>Elmer, with characteristic generosity, had
chosen last, and hence he lay nearer the outside of
the shelter than any of his mates. But having
known what it was to be exposed to the rigors of
a cold storm, since he had braved a Canadian winter
while up on that ranch, the young scout master
also knew how to make use of his blanket as
though it were a sleeping bag.</p>

<p>The hours dragged slowly along.</p>

<p>Afterwards they would always look back, and
shudder as they remembered how terribly long
that night did seem. And yet none of them really
suffered, save that it was impossible to sleep, only
in snatches.</p>

<p>This was on account of several things. In the
first place, they were jammed together in a way
to which they were wholly unaccustomed; and
when one stirred on becoming cramped it aroused
all the others in turn. Then their strange surroundings
had more or less influence upon them.
Not that there was any furious noise, such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
would have accompanied a summer gale; but the
weird moaning of the wintry wind through the
leafless branches of the oaks, and the bending tops
of the pines, made a music that kept them thinking
they heard human voices calling for help.</p>

<p>Another reason why Elmer had chosen the outside
place when lying down was his desire to keep
watch upon the fire.</p>

<p>It was his intention to keep this going as long as
possible, though a fellow built on the order of
George would have complained bitterly had he
been compelled to crawl out of his snug nest several
times in order to face that pitiless storm, and
pile more fuel on the smouldering logs.</p>

<p>Elmer was one of those boys who, knowing his
duty, always went about it without any brag or
bluster, and could be depended on to sacrifice his
own comfort in order that his chums might benefit.
In other words Elmer was what you might call an
ideal scout. He seldom had any trouble about
practicing those twelve cardinal principles that
govern the working day of a scout&mdash;to be trustworthy,
loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,
obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.
They came naturally to him.</p>

<p>Three times did he perform this fire-building
act. The last occasion must have been well on
toward the hour of three in the morning, as he
judged from certain conditions, though he could
not bother looking at his little silver watch.</p>

<p>At that time the storm was keeping it up just
as wildly as ever, and there was much more than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
foot of snow on the ground, where it had not
drifted; with any quantity still to come down.</p>

<p>After that Elmer must have secured better
sleep, for he did not wake up again until a movement
accompanied by a voice aroused him.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! let me tell you the bottom's
dropped out of the mercury tube this time, boys!"
the voice went on to bellow, and he recognized the
tones as belonging to George, who had not been
heard from ever since he first curled up in the
folds of his warm blanket.</p>

<p>He was raising his head now, and observing his
breath as it congealed in the frosty air. Elmer
knew that the time to sleep had passed, because
it was daylight.</p>

<p>"How about that snow, has it stopped?" asked
another voice, as Toby sat up, and began to stretch
his arms upon which he may have been lying so
that they felt more or less numb.</p>

<p>"Still coming down as hard as ever," Elmer
told him, shaking quite a lot of the feathery stuff
out of the folds of his blanket; and then struggling
to his feet.</p>

<p>There was no lounging around that morning.
It was so cold that every fellow was glad to get
into action immediately he came out of his blanket.
George begged to be allowed to lie there
until the fire got good and warm. He urged
every plea he could think of, saying they would
only get in each others' way by crowding; and
that too many cooks always spoiled the broth, anyway;
but Toby and Lil Artha declared they had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
use for a shirker; and if he did nothing else he
could stand up and serve as a windbreak for the
"willing workers."</p>

<p>The fire had gone completely out, and several
inches of snow covered the spot; but wise, long-headed
Elmer had provided against such a contingency
on the evening before, for he had a handful
of fine wood, light and dry, handy, with which
to make a fresh start.</p>

<p>After things got to moving it was not so bad.
The scouts soon felt even a little cheerful over the
situation, because a crackling fire is one of the
greatest inducements to raising one's spirits ever
discovered. When shivering with the cold, and
hungry as well, the world looks pretty blue to any
one; but let that same person come in close contact
with a fire that warms him up, and things
quickly take on quite a different hue.</p>

<p>Then there was that fragrant odor of coffee and
bacon cooking on the fire that tickled the noses of
the boys; nothing could beat that for good cheer&mdash;"if
only they had more of the same," as George
constantly reminded them, even when enjoying
his share.</p>

<p>"Strikes me this is a mighty slim breakfast,"
he remarked, as he found that he had already
caused more than half that was on his pannikin
to vanish, and yet his appetite seemed as sharp
as ever.</p>

<p>"You never spoke truer words, George," said
Toby, soberly, "but when you stop to think what
a small amount of stuff we've got along with us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and the bad fix we're in, you can understand that
we've got to cut the allowance down."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Lil Artha, "of course you've
heard of shipwrecked mariners being in a boat,
and drifting around on the big ocean for days and
days. Well, they always have to go on half rations,
both with food and fresh drinking water.
Anyhow we won't have to bother our poor heads
about that last, because all we have to do is to
melt snow and get what we want."</p>

<p>"Hang it, I wish we could melt all the old white
stuff; I hate it!" George continued, being a poor
loser.</p>

<p>"And yet I've heard you fairly raving over the
beautiful snow," chuckled Lil Artha, "but then
that was when you were out sleigh riding with
Polly Brett. Makes considerable difference what
your condition is, how you look at things. For
my part I don't hanker after snow one bit right
now. Seen all I want to of it to last me all winter;
but then what's the use bothering your head about
things that can't be changed. It's a condition,
not a theory, that confronts us, and what we want
to do is to set our minds to work wrestling with
the question of how we're going to crawl out of
this difficulty and find Uncle Caleb's shack."</p>

<p>"Whew! mebbe I don't wish we were there now,
snug under his roof, and telling him all about our
adventure, as well as how Elmer here found a way
to pull his chums out of a hole, like he always
does," and Toby, while saying this, gave the scout
master a sly look, as though begging him to tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
them some hopeful news that would buoy their
sinking spirits up.</p>

<p>"I wish I had as much confidence in myself as
you seem to feel in me, Toby," was what Elmer
told him, "but I couldn't say the storm is nearly
over, because it's coming down as hard as ever,
and goodness knows when it means to let up.
But we're a lively bunch, you know, and we're
bound to find some way of getting out of this
scrape."</p>

<p>"We've been in others just as tough, remember,"
Lil Artha declared, "and always did get to
the top of the heap in the end."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk," Elmer continued;
"confidence is always one half of the battle.
We've proved that on many a hard-fought field,
baseball, football and hockey as well. If you can
force yourself to believe you will win, the chances
are improved three-fold."</p>

<p>"Well," said George, drily, as he stared very
hard at his now empty platter, "I'm doing my
level best to force myself to believe this pannikin
is heaped high with beefsteak and fried
onions and fried potatoes; now if I've got a third
of a chance to get what I'm wishing for, even that
much would fill a long-felt want. But say, none of
you see any grub coming along on my dish do you?
Well, wishing don't seem to do any good. I'm as
hungry as ever, too, worse luck. Even speaking
of such splendid eatings seems to make my mouth
water."</p>

<p>"Then stop it!" cried Toby; "think all you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
want to, but the rest of us have feelings as well as
you, and it's cruelty to animals to even mention
such things as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on there! don't you aggravate things by
mentioning that list again, or I'll proceed to roll
you out of this hole into the snow drifts!" threatened
Lil Artha, pretending to make a threatening
gesture, while Toby threw up both hands in token
of abject surrender.</p>

<p>"I'm dumb as an oyster, Lil Artha," he protested.
"I haven't got another word to say; but
if there's got to be any ejecting done let's grab
the right party, and see that he gets his full dose."</p>

<p>George had meanwhile managed to pick up a
couple of extra crackers, and having his mouth full
did not make any reply. Lil Artha deftly
snatched the box away from him, and closing it,
calmly placed it out of reach.</p>

<p>"No hogging, now, George," he went on to say;
"share and share alike is the rule we've got to
go by from now on. If there's any hungry feeling
swinging around, it's going to be no one-sided
game. Others can feel empty as well as the Robbins
family pet. But let's hope that before
another night we'll all be sitting around a table
in Uncle Caleb's shack, as warm and cozy as four
bugs in a rug."</p>

<p>The mere thought of having to spend a second
night amidst those enormous snow drifts gave the
boys an unpleasant feeling. They turned and
looked out from under their rude shelter. The
fire itself was cheery; but beyond this lay the piles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of snow, the grim trees with their white arms extended
like monuments in the burying ground at
Hickory Ridge, and with the air full of still rapidly
falling flakes, as though the weather man up aloft
had an unlimited supply of white geese to pluck on
this special occasion.</p>

<p>For a short time no one said a word. They
were all busy with thoughts, perhaps connected
with their happy homes, so far removed; or it
might be trying to picture the cheery scene Lil
Artha had spoken of when he mentioned that cabin
of Uncle Caleb, the man of science, and the small
animal photographer and trapper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SNOW-BOUND</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I don't</span> believe there ever was such a furious
snow-storm as this before!" Toby remarked, after
a while, with a little pensive sigh, as though he
had already begun to repent having conceived that
brilliant idea, in the following out of which they
had fallen into their present serious predicament.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's because the wish is father to the
thought, Toby," Elmer told him. "We all like to
stand up ahead of the other fellows. If you were
home right now I reckon you'd just say that it was
a pretty decent sort of a storm; but being cooped
up here in the woods makes things look different."</p>

<p>"How deep do you think she is on the level,
Elmer?" asked Lil Artha; "as much as three
feet?"</p>

<p>"Nothing like that," replied the other, quickly;
"you mustn't judge by seeing what's piled up
there. That's a drift, and the eddies of wind have
been piling it up all night long. You see the snow
is as dry almost as powder, owing to the cold. It's
quit falling in big flakes, and is sifting down now
in fine stuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, and it gets down your back every time, if
you don't look out," complained George. "This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
beats my time all hollow. I wonder how it'll end."</p>

<p>Elmer purposely made out to mistake the croaker's
meaning; he knew that George was thinking
of the dismal outlook by which they were confronted,
but chose to pretend it was something else
that was intended.</p>

<p>"What, this storm, George?" he said, cheerily;
"oh! it'll wind up before a great while. They all
have their innings, you know, some longer than
others."</p>

<p>"I should say this was one of the longest, then,"
George affirmed.</p>

<p>"But after it does stop we can make up our
plans, and start to carry the same out," Elmer
continued, knowing that if he kept the minds of
his companions employed in some fashion they
would not find much time to worry. "I'm going
to settle down pretty soon by the fire here, and
figure things out again. This time we want to
make a sure job of it. I know the wiggly route
we've taken to get here, following that little creek,
and I've settled it in my mind just which way we
ought to go to remedy our blunder."</p>

<p>"It wasn't so much a mistake as false tips we
received, you remember, Elmer," Lil Artha was
quick to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, that skunk told us wrong just to have
what he thought would be a silly joke on scouts,"
Toby added. "Guess he thought we considered
ourselves some punkins because we wore khaki
suits, and he was mean enough to want to take us
down a peg. I'd like to see that same chap again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
What I wouldn't do to him wouldn't be worth
telling."</p>

<p>"At any rate he's forced us to have a novel
experience," Elmer told them. "Only for his
sending us on a false scent we wouldn't have had
the chance to know what scouts can do when storm-bound
in a snow forest. Some time, when it's all
away back in the past, and you can sit and think
of it without getting furious, perhaps none of us
may feel quite so hard about that young scamp's
work."</p>

<p>"Huh! about that time begin to feel of your
shoulders," grunted George, "because I reckon the
wings will have started to sprout. If I had <i>my</i>
way I'd condemn that rascal to spend a whole week
in a snow camp, with only six matches along, and
just enough grub to keep him from starving. Half
rations and George Robbins don't seem to agree
very well."</p>

<p>"Nothing seems to agree well with you this
morning, George," remarked Lil Artha; "I hope
it don't turn out to be catching."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying that, Lil Artha?"
demanded the other, suspiciously.</p>

<p>The tall scout shrugged his shoulders as he went
on to cautiously explain.</p>

<p>"Why, you know we were talking about shipwrecked
sailors a while back, and how they often
had to go on half rations because they carried so
little in the boat with them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go on," urged George.</p>

<p>"Once in a while it gets even worse than that,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Lil Artha continued, gravely, "and they have to
draw lots to see who will be sacrificed, so that the
rest of the bunch can live."</p>

<p>"Aw! come off, and quit that!" cried George;
"you're just trying to scare me, and it don't go
worth a cent. Nobody is going to starve here in
the woods where we can find some sort of meat to
eat, even crow, if we have to come to it, or perhaps
muskrat. That's a mighty poor joke, Lil Artha,
let me tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, of course I'm hoping myself that
things'll never get <i>just</i> that bad," the tall scout
went on to say, "but only supposin' they did, and
the choice fell on you, I'm wondering if ever afterwards
the three of us would have to go around all
our lives finding fault with everything. I wouldn't
like that, George."</p>

<p>"But what about yourself?" demanded the
other; "you might happen to be the first victim
after all, Lil Artha."</p>

<p>"That makes me smile," he was informed,
coolly; "d'ye think now anybody with eyes in his
head would be so silly as to pick out a bony scarecrow
like <i>me</i> when they could settle on a nice
plump chicken of your build?" and he playfully
dug his fingers in George's ribs as he said this.</p>

<p>"Let's change the subject," Toby broke in with;
"this always talking of eatin' seems to jar on my
nerves. It sets me to thinkin', and that empty
larder stares me in the face. Something's got to
be done about it."</p>

<p>"Sure it has," echoed Lil Artha, eying George<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
closer so that the other squirmed uneasily, and
edged further away from him.</p>

<p>"If we stay right where we are nothing will
come to us, will there, Elmer?" Toby pursued.</p>

<p>"If you mean anything in the way of game we
could hardly expect it," replied the scout master.
"The fellow who generally gets there is the one
who goes out and finds what he wants, and doesn't
hang around home waiting for something to turn
up. That's what wideawake scouts believe in."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! that's the ticket! And when can we
make a start?" demanded Toby.</p>

<p>"If there's any sign of the storm letting up by
noon, we'll clear out and take our chances of finding
Uncle Caleb's shack before night-time," he
was told.</p>

<p>"And as the snow's so deep," Toby rattled on,
"what's to hinder me from trying my bully snow-shoes?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of," Elmer remarked;
"only I'm afraid you won't find the going as easy
as you expect."</p>

<p>"I won't, eh? What's the reason?" asked
Toby, who always wanted to be shown.</p>

<p>"You're a new beginner, in the first place, and
a knowledge of how to walk on snow-shoes is something
that's got to be gained by experience. I've
been on them up in Canada; and they had to dig
me out lots of times before I learned how to stand
straight. If once you slip it's good-bye to you.
Down your head goes, and you can't get up alone
because of the clumsy big shoes. They always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
carry a long stick to keep from taking these headers,
especially when going it alone."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked the aspiring one, as
he took up the pair of splendid snow-shoes Uncle
Caleb had sent him, and made as if to secure his
toe in place with the thong intended for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's another thing that will make it
doubly hard," Elmer informed him. "Dry snow
like this is the toughest kind to walk over. When
hunters go after deer or moose on snow-shoes they
always pick a time after a thaw, when a return of
the cold has frozen the wet surface of the deep
snow. Over this thin ice they can run three times
as fast as the poor deer, which breaks through
with every jump, and flounders almost helplessly."</p>

<p>"That sounds almost like plain murder, do you
know," Lil Artha vehemently declared, frowning
at the idea.</p>

<p>"Well, if you were hungry, and that was the
only way to get near a venison mebbe you wouldn't
feel so particular," George told him. "I know
right now that I wish a splendid buck was doing
some of that same floundering near us, and Elmer
had a chance to settle his hash for him. It'd sure
do me a heap of good just to know we had enough
grub for a week, and then some."</p>

<p>"That's a forbidden subject, George," remonstrated
Elmer, who wanted to get the minds of his
chums directed in more pleasant channels; "let's
all get together and compare notes about direction.
I said I had a plan, but then I might be off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
my base, and some of you could correct me. Four
heads are better than one all the time."</p>

<p>His scheme succeeded, for presently he had
managed to get them deeply interested in the subject
of location, so that one after another put forward
some plan.</p>

<p>It was about all they could do, under the circumstances,
that and keeping the fire burning. Even
George so far forgot his troubles as to suggest
several things that were well weighed before being
rejected.</p>

<p>As it turned out, after the conference, Elmer
had changed his figures a little, and the latest plan
was to head a point south of northwest when they
started forth in hopes of finding shelter from the
storm.</p>

<p>No one knew the grim necessity for action better
than Elmer. While he tried to assume a pleasant
face in order to keep the courage of the others up,
he understood the serious character of their condition
far more than he was willing to openly
admit.</p>

<p>They could not expect any one to come and find
them, if they continued to stay where they were;
and besides the scantiness of their provisions entailed
the necessity for doing some sort of hunting
in the snow forest in hopes of securing a new supply.</p>

<p>As the morning dragged on many anxious
glances were cast out to where that fine powdery
substance was showering steadily down, adding to
the tremendous quantity that was already on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
ground. If it would only begin to slacken how
thankful they would be.</p>

<p>On several occasions some one would exclaim
that it looked as though the snow might be coming
down in lessened quantities, but no sooner did
they begin to pay close attention than the storm
seemed to start in again as furiously as ever.</p>

<p>So the time drew near the middle of the day, and
as yet they could not say that there was any hopeful
sign.</p>

<p>"If it gets along past noon we're in for another
night here, I'm afraid," Lil Artha argued, "because,
you remember the old saying, 'between
eleven and two, it'll tell you what's it's going to
do.' Needn't chuckle that way, George, because
I've often seen that proved. Seems like that's a
turning point most times, if there's going to be
any change."</p>

<p>"All silly bosh!" George went on to say, for at
least he was not given to believing in "signs" and
such things; "haven't I many a time seen a storm
go on past noon, and look as black as a pocket,
only to clear handsomely about four or five, with
the grandest rainbow in the west you ever saw?
Those sayings are all bunco, Lil Artha. I'm surprised
at as sensible a scout as you admitting that
you believe in any of the same. I'm not superstitious,
whatever else I may be."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, it doesn't matter which one's right,"
the tall scout observed; "the thing is there's always
a fair chance of its breaking around noon;
and let's hope it'll be kind enough to do that same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to-day. I know Elmer wants to make a move as
much as any of us, don't you, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I don't care how soon it comes along,
either," he was told without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>"There's one comfort we've got," said Toby.</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear it, then," George muttered, disconsolately,
eying the other half suspiciously, as
though he feared another trap intended for his
unwary feet.</p>

<p>"We've got stacks of coffee along, and can always
have a cup to cheer us up. I think that
counts a lot. It not only warms you inside, but
gives you courage to face your troubles like a true
scout."</p>

<p>"And yet some scouts are never allowed to drink
tea or coffee," suggested George.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for them, that's all," Toby continued;
"we don't happen to fall in that class, do
we, fellows? My folks let me have one cup every
morning; and when I'm in camp I c'n drink all I
want. There, look and tell me if you don't think
it seems to be lightening in the northwest, Elmer;
because that's where all this awful snow is coming
from."</p>

<p>"It does look a little better, for a fact!" admitted
the scout master, after he had taken a critical
observation; "of course I'm not a weather-sharp;
and my prediction may not be worth a
pinch of salt; but if you asked me I'd like as not
say I really believe it was going to break."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted both Lil Artha and Toby in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
concert; for this was the first time Elmer had committed
himself to saying what he thought about a
possible change in the weather.</p>

<p>More anxiously than ever they waited and
watched. The snow did not come down quite so
heavily, and was constantly lessening in force. A
stiff wind had arisen that cut like a knife; they
hoped this was blowing the gray clouds away, and
that soon the cheery face of the sun would peep
forth through a gap in the curtain overhead. All
of them stood ready to greet his advent with a
rousing cheer.</p>

<p>"Here, let's get our coffee started, so we can
move out right away, if things look good to us!"
Elmer told them; and it seemed as though there
were four times as many cooks as the supply of
food warranted, because every one wanted to have
a hand in preparing their scanty lunch.</p>

<p>As one of them had said it promised to be pretty
much "coffee and point," and of course he was
compelled to tell how the poor Irish during famine
times were accustomed to hanging a bit of bacon
over the table, and as they ate their potatoes they
would point the same at it, as though in imagination
they might get some of the flavor that way.</p>

<p>"The Irish were long on praties, and short on
bacon," Lil Artha commented, "and with us it's
a case of plenty of coffee, and a famine in other
kinds of grub; but better times are coming soon,
boys, when we'll have plenty," and he managed to
cast another of his wicked looks in the direction of
George, which being seen by that worthy caused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him to curl his lips in derision, and return the hint
with an expression that seemed to say: "you'll
have to wait a long time before you taste <i>me</i>, Lil
Artha, and don't you forget that!"</p>

<p>Things got better and better as the cooking progressed;
that is to say, overhead the clouds were
plainly showing ragged signs, as though they must
presently break, and the storm be of the past.</p>

<p>This fact gave the four boys some reason for
cheering up. It was a bleak immediate future that
stared them in the face, but being young and full
of hope they easily found many things to pin their
faith on. Youth is apt to be buoyant, and see only
the present; George's habit of complaining, and
being a pessimist, doubtless sprang from a poor
digestion, and could easily be remedied if he went
on a plain diet.</p>

<p>"Watch the smoke, how it goes straight up when
the wind stops," Elmer told them. "That's a
good sign, and every old hunter knows it. Smoke
hugs the ground when the air is heavy with moisture,
and ascends when it's dry. I'm more certain
than ever now that we're seeing the tail-end of our
storm."</p>

<p>"The worst is yet to come," croaked George.</p>

<p>"Smells pretty fine to me," said Lil Artha,
sniffing the air, which was charged just then with
a delightful aroma of coffee.</p>

<p>"I only wish all of you were as lucky as me,"
Toby broke in with, showing that he could not tear
his mind away from contemplating his present.
"Think how slick we'd go skimming along over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the big drifts on our snow-shoes, and not caring
five cents whether school kept or not."</p>

<p>"Mebbe we would, and again mebbe we'd be
sorry," George told him. "Things ain't always
just what they seem. Lots of times you think
you're going to have a nice swell drink, and swich!
the glass drops, and is broken into bits."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got aluminum drinking cups, so
there's no danger of that thing happening to us,"
practical Lil Artha assured him, for he never
bothered his head about evil omens, and all such
nonsense.</p>

<p>Toby, who had been bending over the fire, happened
to look around presently. Perhaps it was
his intention to add some brilliant remark to what
he had already said in connection with snow-shoes;
but if this were so the thought was driven
completely out of his head by something else.</p>

<p>"Oh! my stars! would you see that?" he almost
shrieked.</p>

<p>Startled by his exclamation, and half believing
that he must have discovered at least a hungry
lynx about to spring into the camp, the others
whirled around and then they in turn stared as
though hardly able to believe their eyes.</p>

<p>A splendid stag had come bounding along
through the deep snowdrifts, unaware of the fact
that human enemies were so near by, since the
wind carried the scent of their presence, as well
as the smoke from the fire, in another direction.
He had apparently just discovered them at the
instant they all looked, for with a flirt of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
antlered head he was making off, jumping gracefully
through the deep snow, and doubtless picking
his way, even though dreadfully alarmed.</p>

<p>Elmer had started to look for his Marlin, but
realizing the hopelessness of getting a shot he
desisted, and watched the splendid animal vanish
from view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WANDERING THROUGH THE DRIFTS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a chagrined and sadly disappointed lot
of scouts who turned and looked at each other
after the last had been seen of the fleeing buck.</p>

<p>"What a splendid set of antlers he had!" Lil
Artha exclaimed.</p>

<p>"To think of how close we came to having a
supply of fresh meat!" groaned Toby, shaking his
head dismally, as he put a hand on the pit of his
stomach, just as if he wished to call their attention
to its depressed appearance.</p>

<p>"Was it really a deer?" asked George. "Now,
you needn't all turn on me so savagely, like you
think I'm away off my base. I've known hungry
people to imagine they saw things. Ain't it
always the thirsty traveler who sees the mirage on
the desert, and thinks he can hear the gurgle of
the running water as he looks at the river boiling
among the rocks? Course it is; and so I say
again, was it really a deer, or did we just <i>think</i> we
saw one?"</p>

<p>Knowing the folly of trying to convince George
when he chose to question even his own eyes, the
others made no attempt to swing him around to
their way of thinking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"That goes to show us the meaning of our motto
'Be Prepared,'" Lil Artha continued. "Now, if
either Elmer or me had happened to have a gun in
our hands how easy it would have been to bowl that
fine buck over. And then think what it would
mean to all of us. Wow! after this I'm meaning
to stick even closer to my gun than a brother."</p>

<p>"We always shut the door after the horse has
been stolen," said Elmer, "but even in our misfortune
you can see the silver lining to the cloud
if you look."</p>

<p>"Then for goodness' sake, Elmer, point it out,
so George can get that sour frown off his face.
He don't believe what he sees, and yet he's grieving
worse than any of us because we didn't get that
venison when we had the chance."</p>

<p>"If there's one deer up here in this forest there
must be others," Elmer told them. "You may
have noticed that he went off in about the same
direction we expect to head in when we start. We
may see him again, and if that luck comes our way
we'll try and be ready next time."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later and chancing to look out over
the snow Elmer saw a moving object that gave
him a start, until on looking a second time he made
it out to be only George, who was prowling
around, looking for any signs the deer may have
left as he broke through the deep snow drifts.</p>

<p>Evidently George must have been convinced, for
when he came in later there was a satisfied expression
on his face; and noticing Elmer observing him
the doubter nodded his head, and simply said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a deer all right; I saw his tracks out
there!"</p>

<p>They had been sitting by the fire eating their
frugal lunch for something like five minutes when
the sun suddenly looked down at them, dazzling
their eyes with his bright beams glinting from all
that snow.</p>

<p>Of course the four boys immediately broke out
into a shout, they were so glad to see the cheerful
face of the sun again. The meal was finished in
record time; but then perhaps that was not to be
wondered at, for the supply had run far short of
the demand; and Lil Artha, after polishing his
pannikin until he could almost see his face in the
same, jocosely remarked:</p>

<p>"The sample was pretty fine; now bring on the
dinner!"</p>

<p>They were so eager to get moving that they did
not allow their state of hunger to give them much
concern. The rude shelter was taken down,
though they had some trouble with the rubber
ponchos, as they seemed to be frozen stiff under
the accumulated snow, which from time to time
had thawed in the heat of the fire, only to congeal
again later on.</p>

<p>In the end, however, everything was packed as
before, and having secured their blankets over
their shoulders again, the scouts were ready to
make a start. Toby had made his threat good,
and had his wonderful snowshoes on. He struck
out bravely enough, and at first seemed to be able
to easily outstrip his companions. This caused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
him to feel an unnatural exultation, for he began
calling back at them, and derisively telling them
to "hurry up," that they were "too slow a bunch
for him," and all that sort of nonsense.</p>

<p>Then suddenly this tirade ceased.</p>

<p>"Wonder what's happened to him now?" Lil
Artha remarked, turning a grinning face toward
Elmer, who simply replied:</p>

<p>"Wait and see, and be ready to laugh, though
it's never a laughing matter to the fellow with the
snowshoes!"</p>

<p>As Elmer had expected would be the case they
presently discovered something floundering in
the snow, which upon closer inspection proved to
be Toby's feet. He had lost his balance while
negotiating a big drift, and in spite of the assistance
afforded by the long staff he carried, had
taken a plunge, so that when they arrived his feet
were where his head should be.</p>

<p>Elmer knew how to go about it in order to right
the novice. Toby was no longer bubbling over
with enthusiasm as he once more started off.
He was learning that even innocent looking snow-shoes
may have traps concealed about them for
the unwary; and afterward he conducted his advance
with much more caution.</p>

<p>In spite of this, however, the others had to rescue
him regularly about once every fifteen minutes,
until finally even Toby was ready to call the
experiment off for the time being.</p>

<p>"I'll get there yet, see if I don't," he assured
the others, as they gathered around to watch him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
take the big cumbersome things off his feet, and
sling them over his back. "Uncle Caleb'll teach
me how to use 'em; and besides, Elmer, didn't you
say this was mighty poor snow for a learner to
start out with? Gimme time, and I'll master the
trick yet, see if I don't."</p>

<p>Elmer did not doubt in the least but what he
would, because this sort of talk showed the determined
spirit that always gets there in the end,
no matter how many difficulties may be encountered
by the way.</p>

<p>They found it hard traveling through all that
accumulated snow, even though the pilot of the
expedition made it a point to pick out the easiest
course, avoiding most of the drifts, though keeping
on the course he had laid out in the beginning.</p>

<p>As they went they used their eyes to the best
advantage, hoping to discover something in the
shape of game, little they cared whether it might
be a covey of partridges, a rabbit that was out of
its burrow at the wrong time, a deer, or even so
small a thing as a gray squirrel.</p>

<p>As the afternoon began to wear on, and their
progress was becoming slower all the while, on
account of weariness, and the difficulty of pushing
through the snow, their hopes took a downward
turn with the drop of the sun toward the
horizon.</p>

<p>Everywhere lay that unending white blanket.
The breeze had stopped, and it seemed as though
a deathly silence lay upon all the region roundabout
them, now and then disturbed when some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
rotten limb broke under the weight of snow, and
crashed to the ground; for in the beginning, before
it became so cold, the falling flakes had clung
tenaciously wherever they dropped, and thus the
trees were in places bending double with their
burden.</p>

<p>Still not the slightest sign did any of the boys
discover of human presence. If only they could
have caught the ringing echo of a woodman's ax,
or hear the hello of a hunter returning to camp
with game on his back, what a thrill must have
passed through their whole bodies; but to have
that terrible silence around them was discouraging,
to say the least.</p>

<p>All of them were staggering more or less by
now. It was the absence of hope as much as the
fact of their being tired that caused this. Could
they have glimpsed smoke curling upward a mile
ahead, to tell them of succor, doubtless even
George, who was more worn out than any of the
others, would have started on a mad rush to reach
the coveted camp where comfort and plenty
awaited them.</p>

<p>But that was not fated to be just then. The
scouts had by accident found themselves entangled
in a network of difficulties, and there were still
other experiences awaiting them before they could
expect to reach the end of their adventure.</p>

<p>All of them seemed to be holding up as well as
could be expected. George could forget his weakness
when he chose, and show that he had the right
sort of stuff in him, just as Elmer had known all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
along. He did not complain even as much as
Toby did; though perhaps that worthy was soured
by his keen disappointment in connection with his
wonderful snow-shoes, which after all had only
been a delusion, a snare, and a burden up to date.</p>

<p>They knew that this sort of thing could not keep
up a great while longer, for the sun would soon be
ready to set in the west, and they must think to
prepare for another dismal night in the endless
snow forest.</p>

<p>Somehow no one mentioned anything about the
prospect ahead now. They dreaded it more than
ever, because the conditions were gradually getting
harder all the while. When a parcel of well
grown boys, with the healthy appetites of their
kind, are reduced to cutting their rations down to
one-half, they do not face the future with anything
approaching enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Their manner of march was about like this:
Elmer went in front, breaking a way, as it might
be described, and his was the eye that had to pick
the course, avoiding all the difficult drifts as much
as possible, though heading into the near-northwest
as arranged at the time they laid their plans.</p>

<p>Immediately after him came Toby, puffing like
a porpoise at times, being short of breath; and
occasionally floundering about when he lost his
footing or made a miscalculation.</p>

<p>On his heels George plodded along, looking this
way and that, ever ready to call to Elmer did he
but discover a moving, dun-colored object that
might turn out to be the deer they had missed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Lil Artha brought up the rear, though with
those long waders of his it must have been an easy
task for him to have taken the lead, since they
seemed particularly adapted for carrying their
owner through floods of snow or water. Lil
Artha kept his gun ready at all times. If game
that had been made to hide because of the coming
of Elmer attempted to slink away later on, the
tall scout was on hand, ready to take advantage of
the first opportunity.</p>

<p>So far nothing had rewarded their vigilance,
much to their keen disappointment. That there
was game to be found in the forest they did not
question; but after such a heavy fall of snow it
wisely remained in den or hollow tree, waiting for
a change in the weather before venturing forth.
Hunger would eventually compel most of the animals
that did not hibernate like the bear to issue
forth and seek their accustomed food; but they
could abstain for days, and meanwhile what was
to become of the four scouts?</p>

<p>As they moved along the stillness was disturbed
by the noisy cawing of a flock of crows that seemed
to be disputing some matter. Often had the boys
watched the queer actions of crows when holding
what Toby called a "cawcus," as though trying
one of their number that had been caught doing
something unfair, according to crow laws; but
never had they anticipated they would begin to
observe the noisy black fellows with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>"If it comes to the worst, crow mightn't go so
<i>very</i> bad," suggested Lil Artha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we haven't got to that point yet, remember!"
hastily cried George. "I'm willing to
stand for nearly anything, but eating crow is too,
too much. What d'ye take us for, Lil Artha;
think we're a bunch of defeated politicians, do you,
that have to pay an election wager? No crow for
me until I'm at the last gasp. Get out, you black
rascals;" and he waved his arms in order to make
them fly before Lil Artha could conclude to fire his
gun.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>IN THE FROZEN MARSH</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> it was just as well that the crows took
the alarm, and flew noisily away. If Lil Artha
had taken a shot at them and secured one or more,
there might have been a peck of trouble, not only
for the crows but some of the scouts as well.</p>

<p>They pushed on for some little time after this
in silence. Elmer was constantly on the watch
for a possible camping spot. He hardly expected
they would be as highly favored as on the preceding
night; but then, as no storm threatened,
this was not absolutely necessary. He anticipated
that they would be able to put up some sort
of barrier to keep the keen wind off, clear a place
of snow, and do the best possible with what they
found.</p>

<p>"Looks like we might be on the border of a
sort of marsh," suggested Lil Artha, as he made
an extra effort, and caught up with the plodding
leader.</p>

<p>"Yes, I began to notice that about ten minutes
ago," replied Elmer.</p>

<p>"I only mention the fact," continued the lanky
scout, "because it strikes me that several times
when Toby read out long descriptive letters he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had from his uncle up here the old gentleman told
of getting some of his best views when lying out
in a marsh, and watching the little animals play
tag, or some game like that, build their nests, and
have their scraps. Am I right about that,
Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I can see what you're hinting at, Lil
Artha. You've got an idea this may be that
marsh?"</p>

<p>"Correct!" admitted the tall scout.</p>

<p>"And that if we've finally managed to work
around, and strike Uncle Caleb's favorite stamping
grounds, there's a pretty good chance the cabin
can't be a great ways off?" Elmer concluded,
while his words brought vigorous nods of approval
from the other.</p>

<p>"Wish we could set up a holler that'd reach
him!" ventured Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"We might try a few shots and see if they had
any result, though I'd rather wait till dark before
doing that," the scout master remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Lil Artha pondered over this for a minute before
he made any further remark.</p>

<p>"I reckon you mean you still hope we might
run foul of some sort of game that would give us
a supper?" he finally observed.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the marsh, and while the snow is
deep in most places, we might manage to run
across one of their queer little winter houses, you
know."</p>

<p>Lil Artha must have been thinking along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
same lines as Elmer, if one could judge from the
rapidity with which he took the other up.</p>

<p>"You mean muskrats, don't you, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Just what I do," came the reply. "Beggars
mustn't be choosers, they say; and it looks like
that, or go hungry to-night, because we haven't
got enough stuff on hand for two, much less four."</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are so very bad eating?"
mused the tall scout, wistfully; for prejudice is a
hard thing to conquer; and habit backed by imagination
is responsible for the choice of many a
man's food. What appeals tremendously to one
may cause another to shrink.</p>

<p>Elmer laughed.</p>

<p>"I've heard many men say they think musquash
as good as almost anything to be had in the woods
or swamps up north. The Indians always consider
them a dainty," he told his chum.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, but they are also mighty fond of
baked dog," remonstrated Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"So would you be, if you'd been brought up that
way. Some people can't bear the thought of eating
frogs' legs, and yet those same folks will sit
down and calmly swallow a dozen oysters or clams
on the half shell. Now, I've always said that the
first man who ever gulped down a live oyster had
more nerve even than Napoleon. Then, if you
only travel around, from China to France, you'll
find that things we scorn are called dainties there.
Take snails, which bring a high price in Paris
markets&mdash;have you ever eaten one in all your
life?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on there, Elmer," exclaimed Lil Artha;
"bring on your musquash. I'm ready to give him
a fair trial, and if he tastes good, after this you
won't hear me draw the line even at baked dog&mdash;or
crow. Yes, I've heard of people who say
they've made a meal off crow, and liked it. Why,
down our way the black rascals live on corn, and
I don't see why they shouldn't be eatable, especially
when a fellow has nothing else along."</p>

<p>"Then I tell you what our programme should
be," the scout master continued, as though this
ready admission on the part of the other gun-bearer
had settled the question with him; "we'll
make up our minds about stopping close by here,
and on the border of the marsh. While George
and Toby are fixing camp, and beginning to gather
wood, the two of us can start out and enter the
marsh, keeping within calling distance of each
other. If there's anything doing we'll bag some
game for our supper to-night. How does that
strike you?"</p>

<p>"Tip-top, Elmer, and because the sun is getting
pretty low over there in the west we'd better be
finding that camp-site in a hurry."</p>

<p>"I think I see as good a place as any right
now," the scout master declared, as he pointed
straight ahead. "You can glimpse what I mean
by looking just past that birch that is bent nearly
double with the snow. A dead tree lies on the
ground, and I should think it would give us all
the wood we'll need to-night. That's the main
thing to make sure of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"And there's a heavy growth in sight, Elmer,
that would serve as a windbreak in case it got to
blowing great guns before morning, which I don't
think will happen though. Shall I tell the other
fellows we're at the end of our day's tramp?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because they're both about as tired as can
be, and will be glad to hear the news," Elmer replied.</p>

<p>So Lil Artha fell back in order to get in communication
with Toby and George, who were plodding
along with many a sigh and grunt; for their
packs were heavy, and the going rough, with all
that deep snow to struggle through.</p>

<p>"Hi! hurry along there, fellows!" he called out;
"we're meaning to camp right ahead here. Plenty
of wood for a fire, and a windbreak in the bargain."</p>

<p>"Tell us something about the visible grub supply,
won't you, Lil Artha?" asked Toby, beseechingly.
"Is there a good grocery around the corner,
and does the butcher call for orders every
morning, or just three times a week?"</p>

<p>"Oh! you have to go after your fresh meat,"
laughed the tall scout, "and that's what me'nd
Elmer propose doing, leaving you two to fix the
camp."</p>

<p>"All right," replied the weary Toby, "just as
you say. Anything to oblige; and here's hoping
you run up against the best of success. A broiled
partridge, or three slices of juicy venison in the
fryingpan would about suit my taste."</p>

<p>"They don't grow juicy venison up here, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ought to know, Toby; every kind I ever heard of
was as dry as tinder, and had to be cooked with
slices of bacon to make it taste just right. But
considering that we've made way with the last
scrap of cured pork I guess we'll take it any old
style."</p>

<p>Lil Artha did not think it wise to spring the
muskrat idea too suddenly on those unsuspecting
fellows. He had a vague idea that should Elmer
and himself meet with success, and knock over several
of the marsh dwellers with the unenviable
name, they might skin them, and let their chums
imagine that they were eating squirrel or rabbit
or something like that. Afterwards, when they
had set the stamp of approval upon the dish, the
truth could come out. Prejudice by then would
have been overcome by the knowledge that "musquash,"
the Indian dish, was all right.</p>

<p>When the little struggling party reached the
spot Elmer had selected, and every one had a
chance to survey the situation, a unanimous approval
of his choice was the result.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have done better if you'd tried,"
said George.</p>

<p>"Don't believe there's as good a camp-site
within five miles," Toby added; but perhaps the
tired condition of the boys had something to do
with this endorsement on their part; just then any
place would have satisfied their desires, which
were not very exacting.</p>

<p>The heavy packs were quickly hung from the
lower limb of a tree under which the camp fire was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to be made. It was a pine, and beneath it the
ground seemed to be fairly clear of snow, most of
what had fallen still clinging to the tree itself.</p>

<p>"Better not waste any more time, had we,
Elmer?" asked the tall scout, as he nervously
handled his Marlin gun, anxious to start out after
game.</p>

<p>"No, get busy, please," said Toby; "don't
bother about us, for we know how camp ought to
be made. All we ask is that you come back loaded
down with something to eat."</p>

<p>"We don't care much what it is, if only you cut
out crow," George added.</p>

<p>Lil Artha gave his fellow Nimrod a quick look,
as much as to say, "that lets us out, and we can
fetch home the musquash with a clear conscience&mdash;if
so be we're lucky enough to bag any."</p>

<p>They went away in company. The last words
George flung after the departing comrades was a
caution.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake now, don't go and get lost
in that marsh, or we will be in a bad scrape.
Things are hard enough as it stands without our
getting separated. If you don't just know where
the camp is located give three yells, or fire three
shots as fast as you can. We'll answer you back,
and keep hollering till you show up. Three shots,
remember."</p>

<p>Once the two scouts entered the frozen marsh
they kept together for a short time.</p>

<p>"How'll I know a muskrat house when I see it,
Elmer?" asked Lil Artha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! you've seen them often around home, only
you forget," replied the other, but in order to
make sure, he continued: "you know, they build
their nests or houses a little after the same style
as beaver do, only of course not so big or secure.
If when you're passing a marsh or swampy tract,
and spy a number of what look like irregular
mounds, or heaps of dead rushes, you can make up
your mind muskrats live there. If it's a lake or
a stream they can be found in among the rocks too,
but not as a rule, because there they are apt to run
up against the otter, weasel and the mink, and
there's no love lost between those sharp-toothed
animals and the muskrat. He's a hard fighter,
too, as his jaws tell you, Lil Artha, but hardly a
match for a mink in a stand-up scrap. There's a
muskrat house right now; let's stop and see if the
old fellow is at home."</p>

<p>Accordingly they surrounded the accumulation
of dead rushes and leaves and other refuse, after
which Elmer tore it to pieces, while Lil Artha
stood guard, ready to take snap judgment should
the occasion arise.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a disappointment, however,
for the mound was empty.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, eh?" grunted the tall scout,
lowering his gun, which he had been keeping half
elevated all the while.</p>

<p>"No, and I didn't believe we'd have any success
here soon after I started tearing the thing down,"
replied Elmer. "It showed all the signs of being
a deserted shack."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"What could have happened to the former inhabitant,
do you think?" continued the disappointed
one, to whom even musquash stew was
beginning to appeal more and more, as the chances
of securing any sort of game diminished in proportion.</p>

<p>"I might guess that he chose to change his place
of residence," said Elmer, "or, it might be that
Uncle Caleb fancies the old Indian dish once in a
while. But let's be moving along. The mill will
never grind again with the water that is past; and
we're not going to get our supper by standing
over a muskrat house that hasn't got any owner."</p>

<p>Another start was accordingly made. Elmer
kept track of the direction they were taking. He
did not mean to find himself in a quandary when
they were ready to turn back again, and not be
able to say where the camp lay. Lil Artha knew
he could depend on his chum in that respect, and
hence he did not concern himself in the slightest
degree about such a thing as becoming bewildered.
It is a nice thing to have some one to lean upon at
all times, though the scout master often took Lil
Artha to task because of his willingness to let
another do his thinking for him.</p>

<p>"Let's separate a little," Elmer suggested,
presently, when they had gone along for quite
some distance and found nothing at all. "We
ought to be able to keep in sight of each other
easily enough; and the same time cover a lot more
ground, and in that way increase our chances."</p>

<p>"I'm agreeable," chirped Lil Artha, not suspecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
how great an influence on their future fortunes
even that little incident was going to prove;
"I'll swing off to the right here, and follow this
swale, while you keep straight on. I rather like
the looks of things over this way, and p'raps I'll
run across a colony of those r&mdash;I mean musquash."</p>

<p>"Give me the wolf call if you do," Elmer told
him, smiling at the quick way Lil Artha had corrected
himself when about to give that unpleasant
name to the furry little denizen of the marsh they
were seeking so eagerly, so as to improve the looks
of their larder, and satisfy a craving they felt for
making his acquaintance in a stew.</p>

<p>Elmer watched the tall scout move along the
swale he had mentioned. He fancied that Lil
Artha was about right when he declared it looked
as though something might be found in that direction,
if signs stood for much.</p>

<p>"I certainly hope, then, he strikes it," Elmer
mused as he rambled on, dodging all the drifts
whenever he could, and straining his eyes for a
sight of welcome signs; "because we need it worse
than we ever needed anything before."</p>

<p>He had just succeeded in evading a bad place,
and was about to look again in order to learn
where his chum might be, when without warning
there came two reports in quick succession right
beyond a bunch of thick brush and not two hundred
feet away.</p>

<p>Elmer immediately started toward the spot as
fast as he could go. He thought he heard loud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
words spoken, and was in a fever of suspense,
fearing Lil Artha might have hurt himself, until
rounding the obstruction he saw the other standing
there, holding his Marlin gun dejectedly while
he stared into space.</p>

<p>"Oh! Elmer!" exclaimed the tall scout, as soon
as he noticed that his companion was close to him;
"a deer, as sure as smoke, and I fired point-blank
at him both times; but hang the luck, I must have
missed the beggar, for he gave an <i>aw</i>ful jump, and
went off like a streak, worse luck to me for a
bungler!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LIL ARTHA SAVES THE DAY</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">That's</span> too bad, Lil Artha," said Elmer, "but
no matter, I'm sure you did the best you could."</p>

<p>That was just like Elmer. Plenty of fellows, in
the first flush of keen disappointment, would have
allowed themselves to speak more or less bitterly,
and complain that it must have been rank carelessness
that would account for such bad results.
But Elmer saw that the tall scout was already
suffering keenly; and his first thought was to console
him.</p>

<p>At the same time he was looking about, and
while the chagrined hunter began to aimlessly open
his gun so as to thrust new shells into the barrels,
Elmer went on to say:</p>

<p>"Point out to me just where the deer was when
you fired, Lil Artha."</p>

<p>"Oh! now even you suspect that I just imagined
I saw one, Elmer," sighed the other scout, "but
d'ye notice that log lying across the other, something
like a letter X? Well, he jumped clean over
that when I gave him the second shot. Oh! he was
as big as a barn to me, I tell you, and how I could
ever miss him with the barrel that had the buckshot
shell in it beats my time. I ought never to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
out in the forest alone; I'm a fine duck of a hunter,
ain't I? If it depended on Lil Artha to keep the
camp in game we'd all turn into living skeletons,
like the one in the sideshow of the circus last summer.
Oh, rats&mdash;but not muskrats&mdash;I'm feeling
pretty sick."</p>

<p>Elmer had not waited to listen to all this lament
on the part of the disappointed marksman. Pushing
forward he was now at the crossed logs. Immediately
he called out in a loud voice that seemed
to have an air of excitement about it:</p>

<p>"Hi! there, Lil Artha, come here, and hurry,
too!"</p>

<p>Upon that the tall scout jammed the breech of
his gun shut, having succeeded in reloading the
same, and he lost no time in hastening to join his
chum.</p>

<p>"W-what is it, Elmer?" he asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>The other pointed to his feet.</p>

<p>"What do you call that, and that, and that?" he
asked, impressively.</p>

<p>Lil Artha stared, and over his thin face there
crept a look, almost of rapture, as he ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Blood spots on the snow, as sure as anything,
Elmer! Oh! then I must have hit that deer after
all! I'm glad, and then again I'm sorry. If he
had to get away from us, I'd much rather not a
single piece of lead had found him. Now he'll
only suffer, and it'll do us no good at all."</p>

<p>"Hold on, don't be too sure about that," remarked
Elmer, as he started to step across the
logs, and follow the plainly marked red trail over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the otherwise spotless field of pure snow; "that
chap has been struck hard, and I don't believe he
can go very far before he drops!"</p>

<p>At hearing this Lil Artha became greatly excited.</p>

<p>"Then let's chase after him right away!" he
exclaimed. "Goodness knows we need fresh meat
about as much as anybody could, because we're
almost half starved, and haven't a ghost of a show
at anything else. And if the poor thing does drop
think how mean it'd be to have the foxes and other
varmints gnaw at <i>our</i> deer all night long, while we
sucked our thumbs in camp, and went hungry."</p>

<p>All this while Elmer was following the trail. It
was an easy task, and even the tenderfoot scout of
the troop might have accomplished such a proposition
without being coached.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that it seems to be getting
stronger all the while," he explained to Lil Artha,
who was close at his heels, holding his breath with
eagerness as he tried to look ahead so as to
glimpse the welcome sight of the deer fallen at last
through sheer exhaustion, "and take my word for
it, we're pretty sure to get your game before we go
back to camp."</p>

<p>"Well, that would tickle me more'n I could tell
you, Elmer," the other assured him, with visions
of glorious feasts rising up before his mind.</p>

<p>"And there he is!" added the other, quickly,
"just at the foot of that fir tree!"</p>

<p>They made a spurt, and were soon bending over
the deer, which they found quite dead, though life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had evidently just departed. Lil Artha could
hardly contain himself. He insisted on shaking
hands several times with Elmer, and then did the
same thing with himself, bubbling over with delight.</p>

<p>"Oh! tell me I'm not dreaming, Elmer, and that
I have really and truly shot a fine deer, just when
we needed it the worst kind?"</p>

<p>"There's no mistake about it, old fellow, because
here's your deer as plain as anything," Elmer assured
him, not a little pleased himself at the great
success that had accompanied their hunt.</p>

<p>"Think how the other fellows will yell when they
see it!" Lil Artha continued, "and Toby needn't
be afraid he's going to starve yet a while, need
he?"</p>

<p>"I should think not," the scout master admitted;
"when there's all this fresh venison to be
cooked. The country is saved, Lil Artha, and
you're the lucky one to be our George Washington.
The boys will be wanting to kneel down and
kiss the back of your hand."</p>

<p>"If they try any of that softy business they'll
take a back seat in a hurry, let me tell you," was
what the matter-of-fact scout remarked. "But,
Elmer, ain't it queer that somehow the snow
woods don't look quite so dreary to me now?
Fact is, I kind of think this is as pretty a sight as
I've seen for a long time."</p>

<p>Elmer laughed at hearing that.</p>

<p>"They always say circumstances alter cases,
Lil Artha, and when I hear you talking that way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I know it's true. When a man's as hungry as he
can be and yet live, the world looks different to
him from what it does an hour later after some
kind friend has filled him up. This deer gives you
the magic spectacles through which you view
things in an altogether different light."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Elmer," admitted the
other; "I was feeling blue, and so I looked at
everything through blue glasses. Now I'm seeing
rosy. But say, however will we manage?"</p>

<p>"You mean about getting the game back to
camp, I reckon, Lil Artha?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm striking at, Elmer. We must
be some distance off, and I should think the deer
would weigh between a hundred-and-fifty and two
hundred pounds; a pretty hefty load for two boys,
with all this snow around. And yet to have to
stop so as to cut the deer up would delay us like
fun."</p>

<p>"Wait, and let's look around for a strong pole,"
suggested Elmer, who had seen heavier game than
this carried for miles by two husky cow punchers
or hunters. "I have some good stout cord along,
which we'll use to tie his forelegs together, and
then the hind ones ditto. The pole will pass
through, and is carried on a shoulder of each.
That's the way hunters always get their shoot to
camp, if there are a pair of them."</p>

<p>The necessary pole was soon discovered, and
they managed by means of jumping on the same
to reduce it to the required length. Then the
scout master made good use of his cord in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to secure the legs of the deer in such a way as to
afford a hold when the pole was shoved through.
Nothing now remained but to lift the game, and
start over the back trail.</p>

<p>As long as the light held they would find no difficulty
whatever in keeping on the track; and
should twilight rapidly change into darkness Elmer
had his bearings so that he could lead aright.</p>

<p>Lil Artha had considered that he was "dog-tired"
up to the time he started that deer from
where it had been lying in some brush; but this
was forgotten in the excitement of the hour.
When glorious success rewards the efforts of the
hunter he seems to have been granted a new lease
of life; and weariness is forgotten.</p>

<p>All the same the load was no light one, and the
going very bad. Many times they staggered, and
once both of them fell down. But the snow prevented
any injury, and they were in too satisfied
a frame of mind to complain.</p>

<p>"We'll have our revenge all right later on, Lil
Artha!" the scout master told his comrade as they
got up and dug the snow out of their ears, as well
as shook another accumulation free from their
collars.</p>

<p>"That's right, we will," assented the other,
"and for every tumble like that I promise myself
an additional chunk of deer meat for supper.
Another thing, Elmer, we ought to remember; the
heavier the game the more grub we'll have."</p>

<p>"You know how to see the bright side of things,
Lil Artha," Elmer told him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! anybody can when success comes along.
It takes fellows like you to keep smiling when
things are going wrong all around. But I've
learned a lesson, Elmer, and after this I won't
despair, no matter how dark the clouds look."</p>

<p>"If one deer can reform a scout, what would big
game like an elephant do?" asked Elmer, "but
then again I'm a little sorry too, Lil Artha."</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded the panting hunter who
held up the other end of the pole that bent under
the weight of the suspended game.</p>

<p>"We won't have that chance to settle whether
the Indians knew a good thing when they said
musquash was better than 'coon or 'possum, or
even rabbit stew!"</p>

<p>"Gosh! don't waste a tear over that, Elmer.
Besides, while we're up here with Uncle Caleb,
like as not we'll have plenty of chances to give
that dish a try. But honest to goodness, it
doesn't seem to strike me just as much as it did
before I cracked over this bully young buck for
you said it was a fairly young one, and ought to
eat tender enough."</p>

<p>"I guess that's only natural," the scout master
told him. "While we were facing starvation, why
stewed musquash sounded right good to us; but
with a whole carcass of venison on our hands it's
plain muskrat again; and there you are, Lil
Artha."</p>

<p>"How d'ye think we're getting along by now?"
asked the tall scout with a little vein of entreaty
in his voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! perhaps half-way there, more or less,"
came the reply.</p>

<p>"Whew! think we can make the riffle with this
mountain of a deer, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Seems to weigh about three hundred now,
don't it? That's because we're getting more
tired all the time. But since we've started it
would be a shame to stop. And think of the joy
we'll be bringing Toby, and poor hungry George."</p>

<p>"That does seem to help out some," admitted
Lil Artha, taking occasion to change his end of
the pole from the right shoulder to the left.</p>

<p>"Keep in step with me as much as you can,"
advised the leader; "that does more than you'd
think to make the going easier. It's a point everybody
learns who has to carry heavy burdens this
way. Coolies over in China know it. Horses
running together pull easier if they happen to go
in step. You've watched a pair trying to start,
with a stalled wagonload of freight. When first
one bucks hard, and then the other, there's nothing
doing; but once get them to combine, and away
she goes on the jump."</p>

<p>There was little that escaped the observation of
Elmer Chenowith; and he never failed to try and
impart some of the information he picked up to
those of his chums who did not happen to be so
keen-eyed.</p>

<p>"It's getting dark; and I can hardly see our old
tracks now!" announced the tall scout, presently.</p>

<p>"Well, we're near enough to camp to have them
hear us if we chose to give out a yell," he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
told, reassuringly, "but for my part I think we'd
better keep right along as we have been doing, and
surprise the boys."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought I glimpsed a star through the
trees ahead just then, Elmer, but that couldn't
be so."</p>

<p>"It's the fire, and I've seen it several times, but
didn't want to say anything until you had a chance
to make the discovery for yourself!" Elmer declared.</p>

<p>"Bully for that!" exclaimed Lil Artha, "and
now we've just got to buckle down to our load,
for I'd be ashamed to have to call for help when
we're on the home stretch."</p>

<p>He watched for that welcome glow all the while,
and whenever it came it seemed to give Lil Artha
renewed strength. In this manner, then, did they
finally approach the camp under the pine tree.
Presently they could see the moving figures of
their comrades, and then Elmer announced:</p>

<p>"They must be getting a little worried about
us, because there's Toby standing up and looking
this way as hard as he can. I think you'd better
give a whoop, so as to let them know we're coming."</p>

<p>That was just like Elmer; he wanted Lil Artha
to have the first say, because the honors should be
fitted to his brow. And when the lucky hunter did
give a shout no doubt there was enough of joy in
it to tell those in camp their comrades were not
returning quite empty handed.</p>

<p>When they saw what the two Nimrods were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
carrying slung on that bending pole that rested
on their sore shoulders Toby and George gave a
series of shouts themselves:</p>

<p>"Lo! the conquering hero comes; get the laurel
wreath ready," cried the dancing Toby, and then
adding: "A deer! Tell me about that, would
you? Oh! what great luck. Who shot it? Elmer,
was it you? What, Lil Artha got his buck
after all, did he? Well, well, well, if that doesn't
beat anything I've heard this long while. And
won't we have the grandest feast to-night ever
heard of? Oh! say, I'm just trembling all over,
I'm so crazy with joy, and p'raps weak, too, because
I haven't had enough to eat. Lil Artha,
shake hands with me, won't you; and later on
you've got to tell us just however you managed to
knock such noble game over."</p>

<p>Meanwhile George, who had not said a single
word, went over to where the tired hunters had
dropped their burden. He was seen to bend down
and feel of the animal, first about its antlered
head, and then even down its hind quarters to its
pretty little hoofs. After that he turned to Lil
Artha, and said in a relieved tone:</p>

<p>"Why, it is a deer, sure enough! I was beginning
to think hunger had made us see things that
didn't have any foundation. But after I've
proved my sight by my sense of feeling I can believe
it. And you shot him, did you, Lil Artha?
Well, I want to congratulate you, old fellow."</p>

<p>It was just like Lil Artha, bubbling over with
mischief, and feeling ever so happy because good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fortune had come his way, to look meaningly at
George, poke him suggestively in the ribs as he
had done once before, and with a wink say:</p>

<p>"That's all right, George, and I'm sure I thank
you; but between us don't you think after all
you're the one to be congratulated? Consider
what you've p'raps escaped by my lucky shot.
But it's all right, George, and no reason for you to
lie awake nights after this, worrying. You can
keep on getting fatter and fatter, now, because
the danger is past," and then he watched Elmer
getting ready to exercise his skill in cutting up the
deer, so they could have a supply of meat for
supper.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PRIZE IN THE TRAP</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How's</span> the wood supply?" asked Elmer, while
preparations were going on looking to their having
a generous supply of fresh venison for supper.</p>

<p>"Not so good as last night," replied Toby; "it's
twice as hard to get, you see; but then, George has
agreed to start in again later on, and pile up more
stock. He certainly does swing that little hand-ax
of yours to beat the band, Elmer."</p>

<p>"Did any of your people come from the South
of Ireland, Toby?" demanded the said George;
"because you've got the gift of gab down to a fine
point, and know how to blarney a fellow first-class."</p>

<p>"But you did say you would chop a whole lot
more wood," protested Toby.</p>

<p>"Sure I did," continued the other scout, "but
it was agreed at the same time I'd spell you in the
job, and bring in as much as you did. Now, since
Elmer and Lil Artha have tramped so far, and
lugged this splendid young buck all the way into
the camp, the least the rest of us can do is to make
sure of the fuel supply. And, Toby, I'm going to
hold you to your word."</p>

<p>"Well, after we've dined perhaps I won't feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
so weak as I do now, and then we'll see what's to
be done," Toby acknowledged.</p>

<p>Elmer had made a pretty good job of cutting up
the deer. It was not the first time he had had to
undertake such a task; and besides, he had
watched other hunters accomplish it frequently,
up there in Canada on the farm and cattle range.</p>

<p>Before a great while the four chums were all
busily engaged in cooking meat after various
styles. Some choice pieces had been thrust into
the fryingpan, with a couple of slices of bacon
which Toby managed to resurrect from some hiding
place or other, and from the appetizing odor
that soon began to rise it was evident that they
were going to have a great feast. Other "chunks"
of meat were thrust on the ends of long and stout
splinters of wood, and these were held out near
the red ashes in certain places, where they would
get in contact with the fierce heat, and begin to
brown, hunter-style.</p>

<p>It might as well be confessed right here that in
the end this last method of cookery did not appeal
to the boys as much as the fryingpan style. Perhaps
they did not know just how to go about it, as
experience is needed to get the best results from
anything; but in spite of their labor they found
that while the meat cooked, and even burned on
the outside, it was almost raw within. Still, hunger
causes a camper to forgive such small faults
as this; and as they started on the poorer supply
to finish with that cooked in the skillet, there were
few complaints.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>All of them gorged so much that it became
necessary for them to lie around and rest for some
little time after the meal was over. Indeed Toby
showed a desire to hug his blanket, and doze in the
warmth of the fire, so that George had to urge him
to remember the bargain they had made with
each other, and start to collecting more wood.</p>

<p>Elmer soon joined in the labor, for he knew they
would need all they were able to gather; and besides,
he was so constituted that he could not bear
to lie around when others were working, no matter
how tired he might feel.</p>

<p>So Lil Artha, although he really believed he had
earned his rest, not to be shamed by all this honest
toil on the part of his three mates, also strolled
forth, to return several times dragging some
branch he had managed to break loose.</p>

<p>The collection of firewood was not near so
formidable as on the preceding night but then as
there was no storm in progress now they might
get along fairly comfortably on what they managed
to haul in.</p>

<p>"Lucky thing you put such a fine edge on the
camp hatchet before starting on this trip, Elmer,"
George remarked, pausing in his chopping to recover
his breath.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't think of starting anywhere without
getting everything ready," replied the scout master.
"If you look ahead, and be prepared, you'll
ease things a whole lot most of the time. As there
are no nails to strike in this wood, and every
chopper is warned to keep clear of stones, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
edge ought to hold good through the whole vacation
time. And it's a great joy to see the steel
eat into the wood like that camp hatchet does.
Let me take a whirl at it again, George; you've
done your share of the work in great shape."</p>

<p>So it would seem that despite George's failings
he had many good points about him, and often
expressed a desire to relieve a comrade who had
begun to show evident signs of weariness. Perhaps
by slow degrees he might be weaned from
that exasperating habit of complaining, and forever
doubting things.</p>

<p>All was quiet around them, not even the whispering
of the night wind in the snow-laden branches
of the pines being heard. Toby declared it
seemed as solemn as a funeral to him, and that he
did love the good old summer-time to be outdoors,
while the crickets, katydids, frogs, and everything
else kept up a friendly chorus, that helped a fellow
to sleep. Now it was so "awfully still that
you could almost hear yourself think!" he told the
others, as they began to get their blankets ready
for a night's rest.</p>

<p>Already one experience in bunking amidst the
snow piles had given the boys a number of useful
suggestions from which they meant to profit on
this second occasion. The rubber ponchos were
used, not as a curtain to shield them from the air,
but under their blankets to separate them from
the ground, and serve to keep the dampness away.
The heat of the fire was apt to melt the surrounding
snow to some extent; and the warmth of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
bodies acted after a fashion in the same way; so
those waterproof rubber blankets proved invaluable.
They should always be taken by those who
go to the woods, and will be found to be worth
their weight in silver every time.</p>

<p>Taken in all that was not such a bad night for
the boys. There was no wind, and Elmer managed
to awaken frequently enough to keep the fire from
going out; so that with the blessing of their warm
blankets, which they wrapped closely about them,
the scouts did not really suffer.</p>

<p>Everybody was very glad when dawn came
along, dreary as the aspect might be. It made a
wonderful difference in their feelings just to know
that there was no longer any possibility of immediate
starvation. George must have dreamed
that some trouble had descended upon them, because
the very first thing he did after crawling out
of his blanket was to hurry over to where they had
fastened the balance of the precious venison, encased
in the hide of the deer, to the limb of a tree,
and closely examine the pack; Elmer, who was
watching him, with a smile on his face, heard the
doubter say in a relieved tone:</p>

<p>"Shucks! it must have been a bad dream, after
all; we <i>did</i> get a buck, and had a bully old supper
last night, because here's the rest of the meat, as
plain as anything. Must have eaten too much,
and had the nightmare; but I'm glad it was only a
dream, that's right. Yes, this is frozen fresh
venison, as sure as my name's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doubting George!" sang out Lil Artha, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
it seemed had also been watching and listening
from behind the folds of his blanket; and even
Toby thrust his grinning face in sight to add to
the confusion of George.</p>

<p>They bustled around without any more delay,
because the air was nipping cold, and of course
they were furiously hungry again; boys always
are when they wake up, especially when camping
out, and during frosty weather.</p>

<p>Breakfast was cooked in great shape. It was a
duplicate of the previous night's meal, but then
what did that matter, when there was an abundance
for all? Quantity and not so much quality
was what pleased those four outdoor chums just
then. There was a horrid vacuum to be filled,
and they were more concerned about how this was
to be accomplished than in a lengthy bill of fare.</p>

<p>After that came a consultation&mdash;Lil Artha
called it a "council of war." They sat around
the fire, which felt so good no one was in any
great hurry to abandon it, and talked the matter
dry from all sides. Every one gave expression to
his opinion, and Elmer, acting as master of ceremonies,
tried to extract all that was good and
worth preserving from each proposition.</p>

<p>It was determined first of all to try firing their
guns several times, to see if they could get any
answer. Should Professor Caleb hear the shots
he would be very apt to reply, and in that case
they would have no difficulty in deciding as to
what course to pursue.</p>

<p>Should this fail to bring about any result, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
must make a start; and in the end it was determined
to keep along the border of the marsh.
That was most likely to be one of the places where
the old trapper and wild animal photographer
was apt to conduct most of his operations, and
they would stand a chance of running across some
sign of his presence.</p>

<p>So Lil Artha fired both barrels of his gun, with
about five seconds coming in between; and then
Elmer discharged one of the loads in his weapon,
after waiting a like interval. In this way the required
three shots were sent forth; and Elmer assured
his comrades that this had always been
reckoned a call for help everywhere, in the Far
West, among African tangles, and even down in
South American wilds; so that if Uncle Caleb were
within hearing distance they would surely get a
response.</p>

<p>All of them listened intently after the last shot.
The wind had come up again with the sun, and was
making various queer noises among the treetops;
but still it would have been possible for them to
have caught a shot, if such had sounded from
any quarter near by.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing, seems like!" remarked George,
dejectedly, for of course he was the very first one
to get what Lil Artha called "cold feet," because
there appeared to be no immediate response to
their effort.</p>

<p>"Shall we try it once more, Elmer?" asked Lil
Artha.</p>

<p>"Just a sheer waste of ammunition, and p'raps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
we'll need every bit we've fetched along," grumbled
George.</p>

<p>The scout master, however, decided that it
would be only right to give the scheme one more
trial before utterly condemning it; so having replaced
the empty shells he and the tall boy again
sent out the three shots that would tell any who
heard the signal that some one was in need of
assistance.</p>

<p>There was no answer, though they listened
eagerly, and once Toby started, under the impression
that he had caught a faint hello; but as it was
not repeated he concluded it may have been some
distant owl giving vent to its disappointment at
not getting a full meal during the period of darkness
just passed.</p>

<p>"One thing we might take for granted after
this," Elmer went on to say; "wind's in the
wrong quarter to carry the sound of the shots to
him. So we could judge from that our best course
is to make against the wind. It would seem that
we might have two chances of finding him that
way, to one the other."</p>

<p>The others agreed with Elmer, for they could
easily grasp his meaning; George was seen to
shake his head, however, and it was evident that
he did not have very much faith in such a thing as
success coming to them. And yet if it did, George
could be counted on to be one of the first to say
that he always did believe they were bound to run
across Uncle Caleb, sooner or later.</p>

<p>"Scouts are supposed always to be sure their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fire is dead out before they leave a camp," remarked
Lil Artha, as they trudged laboriously
along, "but in this case I took notice that none of
us seemed to bother our heads even a little bit over
it, and in fact we left it crackling away right
cheerily."</p>

<p>"Well, with a blanket of snow two feet deep on
the ground," observed Toby, "I'd like to know
how the woods could ever get afire this day. And
that blaze was such a good friend to us I didn't
have the heart to throw snow on the same. It'd
seemed too much like calling a dog to you, patting
him on the head after he came, wagging his tail
in a friendly way, and then tying a tinpan to him,
after which you gave him a nasty kick to start
him yelping and running. But here's hoping we
meet up with my uncle before the third night
comes."</p>

<p>"I should say, yes," added Lil Artha; "if this
sort of thing keeps on we'll be likely to spend all
our midwinter vacation roaming around up here,
and getting nowhere."</p>

<p>"And," Toby further complained, with a sad
shake of the head, "we'd laid out to have such a
bully good time at his cabin, learning all about
trapping, and p'raps going out with him nights to
use his flashlight contrivance, and get pictures of
the little fur-bearing animals in their native
haunts."</p>

<p>"Oh! it's going to be all right," announced Elmer,
who as usual saw the bright side of the situation.
"Something's sure to turn up to-day; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
before another night we'll be toasting our feet
in front of a fire indoors, with a bunk to crawl into
when we're sleepy, and something else besides dry
venison at meal times."</p>

<p>"Here, don't say a word against that same venison!"
exclaimed Lil Artha; "it's been a life-saver,
let me tell you. And to think I was ready
to own up I'd missed my deer, only for you, Elmer.
That taught me a lesson I'll never forget,
believe me. After this I'll always look for signs
when I've shot at game, and never just guess at
things."</p>

<p>"Nothing like making sure, every time," remarked
George.</p>

<p>"Guess you go by that motto, old fellow," Toby
told him. "They don't fool you very often, do
they; and never twice on the same racket?"</p>

<p>Along about the middle of the morning, after
they had been making rather slow progress, and
laboring heavily, Elmer was seen to betray sudden
interest, and to quicken his footsteps. Then
he turned, and beckoned wildly to them. As the
other toilers reached his side the scout master
pointed ahead of him, and remarked:</p>

<p>"There's something moving in the snow yonder,
boys; look and see if you can make out what it
is!"</p>

<p>At that they all stared very hard, and Lil Artha
was the first to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Seems to be some sort of small animal switching
around like it might be caught in a trap,
Elmer!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," added Toby, "I saw it jump up then,
and whatever it is the thing looks a sort of silver
gray or black. There, didn't you see again? Elmer,
do you know what it can be?"</p>

<p>"Somebody, and perhaps Uncle Caleb, has
planted a trap right here, and a fox is caught in
the same by its leg!" came the ready reply.</p>

<p>"A fox, did you say!" echoed Lil Artha; "why,
Elmer, none of us ever saw a fox of that color
before. Every one I've ever set eyes on was
either gray or red."</p>

<p>"Let's step up closer," the scout master remarked,
"and we'll be able to tell more about it."</p>

<p>As the four boys continued to advance the little
animal struggled harder than ever to break away,
but without success. It was undoubtedly a good-sized
fox, for they could not mistake that bushy
tail, and the sharp nose as well as shrewd face.
It showed its white teeth quite savagely as they
drew nearer.</p>

<p>"Well, it is a fox all right," Lil Artha admitted,
"though different from any I ever saw in the
woods, or even in a menagerie."</p>

<p>"A good reason for that," Elmer told him,
quietly; "such a silver fox is rare, and too costly
for showmen to keep, as a rule. A red fox may
be worth all the way from five to thirty dollars,
but from what I've read about the value of furs,
the pelt of a genuine silver fox sometimes brings
more than fifteen hundred dollars, even in its raw
state."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! you don't tell me?" exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
George, looking astounded; and of course he did
not believe what Elmer was saying, because it
sounded too incredible for him to swallow.</p>

<p>"Oh! I've read something about these black
foxes, come to think of it," Lil Artha admitted,
"and so this is one, is it? Well, Uncle Caleb must
have known he was around, and set this trap on
purpose to get him."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's about the size of it," added Toby,
"because I happen to know that as a rule he never
bothers trying to trap any of the little animals up
around this section. He used to, just to pass the
winters away, but when he got interested in photography
he said he found ten times as much
pleasure in creeping up on them, and shooting
with a camera, to anything he had ever done before
with a gun. Fact is, he seldom uses his gun
except to get an occasional deer, some partridge
or a rabbit to serve him as fresh meat."</p>

<p>Elmer bent over a little closer, and examined
the condition of affairs.</p>

<p>"We'll have to knock that fox gently on the
head, I guess," he remarked. "You can see that
the trap has cut deeply into his leg, and if he was
let alone another hour or two he would be likely
to gnaw that paw off in order to get free. They
often do this. You see the cruel jaws of the trap
mutilate their leg, and pain so much when they
struggle that in desperation they bite at it until
they get away; and after that a three-legged fox
is found roaming the woods. Besides, it would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a shame for Uncle Caleb to lose that splendid
prize."</p>

<p>"I guess you're about right, Elmer," Lil Artha
observed, "and so we leave it to you to put the
poor little fellow out of his misery. It's been a
tough thing on him because Nature gave him a
silver black coat. If he'd been an ordinary red
fox Uncle Caleb might never have bothered setting
this trap, and he could have gone right along
making his suppers off partridges and such nice
things, or else chickens belonging to any farmers
inside of twenty miles, if there are any. I'll hold
your gun while you do the job, Elmer, because I
don't reckon you'd want to spoil a fifteen hundred
dollar pelt by riddling the same with bird shot."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE COMING OF UNCLE CALEB</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elmer</span> may not have exactly fancied the job,
but he was one of those fellows who can always be
depended upon to perform any duty devolving on
him, no matter how disagreeable. And it was not
to be thought of that they should pass on, to let
the poor little animal gnaw its foot off; as well as
disappoint the trapper when he had made such a
rare catch.</p>

<p>So handing his pack and gun over to the care of
the others Elmer looked about until he spied the
right sort of stick with which he could dispatch the
little beast by a clip on the head, so as not to spoil
the valuable skin in any way.</p>

<p>When this had been done in great shape they
examined the silver fox more closely and admired
the sheen of his coveted coat, for which wealthy
people are ready to pay almost any price.</p>

<p>"Shall we hang it up here above the trap?"
asked Toby, presently.</p>

<p>"What for?" Elmer went on to say.</p>

<p>"Why, so Uncle Caleb can get it when he comes
along," replied Toby; "you wouldn't want to
make him die of heart failure, would you, by letting
him see he'd made a catch of a silver fox, and
that it was gone?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Why, what's to hinder our camping right
here, and waiting for Uncle Caleb to show up?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, what a lot of ninnies the rest
of us were not to think of that!" chuckled Lil
Artha; "I tell you it's a good thing for George,
Toby, and me that we've got you along, Elmer.
We'd be losing our heads next, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be the first time you'd lost your
head, Lil Artha," George hastened to assure his
comrade. "But I want to say that I think the
idea is all to the good, and that I'm ready to
camp right here, and keep on waiting for Uncle
Caleb to show up, whether it takes an hour, a day
or a week; so long as our supply of venison holds
out."</p>

<p>"So far as that goes," Elmer continued, "I
wouldn't be surprised to see him any old time,
because after the storm he'll be anxious to look
into this trap."</p>

<p>Toby stretched his neck and looked all around.</p>

<p>"Don't seem to see anything of him yet," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"When he comes," resumed the scout master,
"I think you'll find it'll be from that direction
over there. I see a good place where we can drop
down and hide; so come on, fellows."</p>

<p>"Hide?" echoed George; "whatever would we
want to be doing that same for, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Just to see how disappointed Uncle Caleb
looks when he gets here, and finds all these signs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
around, the blood on the snow, the hair of a silver
fox in the closed jaws of the trap, and footprints
everywhere," the scout master told him.</p>

<p>Toby was heard to laugh.</p>

<p>"I can just imagine how he'll act," he ventured;
"but then, we'll let him know who got the
pelt before he's had much time to growl."</p>

<p>Elmer held the dead fox up by his bushy tail,
and George was seen to look keenly at it as he
muttered:</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred dollars, and for that measly
little runt? I don't believe there's a word of
truth about the story. Somebody's been stuffing
you, Elmer."</p>

<p>There happened to be a pretty good hiding-place
close by. It lay just about where Elmer
would have picked it out had he been given a
chance. Here they proceeded to settle down, and
make themselves as comfortable as the conditions
allowed.</p>

<p>"Wonder how long we'll have to wait?" Toby
remarked, after they had scraped the snow away,
and made places where they could stretch their
rubber ponchos out and with blankets on top
form comfortable seats upon which to rest their
tired bodies.</p>

<p>"That depends a whole lot on how soon Uncle
Caleb would think to start out, and how far he
has to come to get here," Elmer told him. "The
walking is tough enough for us, and yet we're
young. He's a pretty old man, Toby says, and
might have a harder time of it than we would.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
But then by noon there ought to be something
doing, I'd think."</p>

<p>George had been looking around, and now gave
them the benefit of his observations.</p>

<p>"Plenty of wood handy, notice, fellows; if we
have to hang out here any length of time, why,
we could make a fire, and do our little cooking
stunt all right."</p>

<p>"Why, what's getting into George," remarked
Toby, pretending to be surprised; "he seems
never to get enough to eat. Time was when he
had a little bird appetite, but these days he's like
a hungry bear all the time."</p>

<p>"I don't know what ails me," George replied,
"but it must be going on half rations kind of
frightened me, and now I'm thinking something
might happen again; so I'm bent on laying in a
good supply while it lasts."</p>

<p>"We'll have to look around for a whole herd
of deer if you keep on that way much longer,
George. And I don't know what your folks at
home'll do when you get back again. You'll eat
'em out of house and home, that's right," Lil
Artha expressed himself by saying.</p>

<p>George took this chaffing in good part. He
was feeling splendidly now, since the danger of
their facing real want was of the past.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all right, boys," he told them.
"It was only a little while ago my folks were
worried about me eating so little, and I guess
they'll sing the other way now. Dad'll talk
about going into bankruptcy when he watches me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
put away the food. Seems like I never could get
enough again. I want to eat six times a day, and
then complain because meals are so far apart."</p>

<p>"Listen!" exclaimed Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"What did you think you heard?" asked
Elmer, after all of them had strained their ears
without any result.</p>

<p>"Guess I must have been away off, and it was
only a hoot owl after all; but I thought I heard
some one cough!" the tall scout declared.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that
way, because it's getting on toward time for him
to show up, if he means to come along to-day,"
said Elmer.</p>

<p>"And now that you mention it," added Toby,
"I remember Uncle Caleb does have a sort of
cough. That was one reason he took to the
woods, for he said it was going to add ten years
to his life, living in the open, winter and summer,
and eating the plainest kind of food."</p>

<p>After that they began to watch more closely
than ever, and also listened carefully to catch a
repetition of the sound that Lil Artha believed
he had heard.</p>

<p>The great woods in their white snow mantle
seemed to be deathly quiet. The air had become
far less bitter, and in the sun it was thawing
slightly. Occasionally some branch would manage
to dislodge its burden of snow, which was apt
to rustle through other branches on its way to
the ground. Away in the distance those crows
were cawing again, as though disputing some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
lucky find, or holding a council of war concerning
some contemplated movement in search of new
feeding grounds. Beyond these little breaks the
silence remained profound.</p>

<p>All at once Elmer gave a low "hist!"</p>

<p>The others had caught the same sound, and as
it was repeated again and again they began to
believe that some one must be approaching from
the very quarter in which Elmer had said Uncle
Caleb was apt to come.</p>

<p>"What's that queer scraping, shuffling noise
mean, Elmer?" whispered Lil Artha.</p>

<p>"I bet you I know," spoke up Toby, also in a
cautious tone; "snow-shoes, and my uncle is
wearing the same. How's that for a guess, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"You're right that time, Toby; and there he
comes!" was the scout master's reply.</p>

<p>Looking again they could all see the figure of
an elderly man, dressed in khaki-colored hunting
garments, but warmly clad. He was advancing
over the surface of the heaped-up snow, and with
the free movements of one to whom the use of
snow-shoes was an old story. To see the way he
lifted his feet, still dragging the long shoe made
of bent hickory, and stout gut that crossed and
re-crossed diagonally from side to side, it was
evident that Uncle Caleb had spent many days
and weeks in the woods when it was impossible
for him to get anywhere without the use of snow-shoes.</p>

<p>Toby watched him eagerly. He was evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thinking that before he left this section of the
wilderness he too would be able to walk deftly,
after he had been shown the secret of manipulating
the clumsy contrivances that served to keep
the pedestrian from sinking into the drift.</p>

<p>As the hunter and naturalist drew closer to the
spot where he had placed his fox trap they could
see that he was getting more and more agitated.
Evidently he must have already discovered certain
suspicious signs around that gave warning
to the effect that he was about to receive a shock
of an unpleasant nature.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb was almost running now. Had
there been a glaze on the surface of the snow he
would have fairly flown to the spot; but as it was
he floundered more or less in advancing hurriedly.</p>

<p>Now they saw him bend down to examine his
trap. The presence of the stains on the trampled
surface of the snow would be enough to tell
him that there had been a victim held between
those grim steel jaws of the Newhouse trap.
When he found several almost black hairs present
he would also understand that he had caught
the coveted silver black fox; and while that might
add to his joy under ordinary conditions it was
only apt to provoke his additional wrath just
then; for those telltale footprints all around gave
him to understand he had been robbed of his
treasure.</p>

<p>He presently got up from his knees. They
could see that he was shaking his head as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he did not like the way things looked. Many
winters had Uncle Caleb spent in this vicinity,
and never before had he ever known of a case of
thievery; that it should come when he had made
such a fortunate haul was doubly provoking.</p>

<p>It was hardly wise to carry on the joke any
further, Elmer thought; and accordingly he gave
the signal for which Toby was waiting. The latter
immediately jumped to his feet, and shouted
at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Hello! Uncle Caleb! how d'ye do? You see,
I've kept my word, and dropped in to visit you at
last. And as you told me to bring a friend or
two along, I've fetched our scout master, Elmer
Chenowith, also two other bully good fellows,
George Robbins and Lil Artha Stansbury!"</p>

<p>The elderly recluse stared at the four boys as
though he found great difficulty in believing his
eyes. It was as if they had suddenly bobbed up
out of the snow-covered earth to surprise him.</p>

<p>"Why, hello! is that you, Nephew Toby?" he
presently called back. "Come along and shake
hands with me. You're mighty welcome, my boy,
let me tell you; and your comrades too. I shall
be delighted to meet the Elmer I've heard so
much about in your newsy letters; also your other
chums."</p>

<p>"But, uncle, we've got a little surprise for you,
see?" and as he spoke Toby suddenly held up the
silver fox, which act caused the other to smile
broadly; "we were directed wrong by a boy, who
must have had a grouch against all scouts; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
so we got lost; and then that storm caught us;
but we were hunting around for some sign of
your cabin when we came on this fox caught in a
trap, and with his leg nearly cut off. Elmer said
he'd soon be gone, leaving only a paw behind; so
he knocked him on the head, and then said we'd
better wait here till you came. Is it a real silver
black fox, Uncle?"</p>

<p>"And are the skins worth as much as fifteen
hundred dollars, sir?" asked George, as though
he could never rest again until he had settled that
bothersome matter in his mind.</p>

<p>"Yes to both questions, boys," replied the scientist;
"this skin may be worth anywhere from a
thousand dollars to twenty-five hundred, according
to how it is graded; and I'm delighted that
you had the good sense to save it for me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>POSSESSION NINE POINTS OF THE LAW</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I hope</span> you're satisfied now, George, about
that pelt?" Lil Artha whispered to the doubting
scout, as they stepped back, after shaking hands
with the scientist, who was examining his prize
with considerable delight; not that Uncle Caleb
needed the money he would likely receive for the
skin, if he chose to dispose of it; but it was something
worth while to be able to say he had taken
one of those rare little, and much sought after
animals, a silver fox.</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, I s'pose it must be so, if he says
they're so valuable," George admitted, but in a
way that told how slow he was to take stock in
such a fairy tale; so that later on Lil Artha, finding
Uncle Caleb had certain articles that had
been published in connection with the wonderful
prices paid for silver fox skins in the open London
market, took pains to see that the doubter
read them, and was finally convinced.</p>

<p>"Nothing else would have fetched me out after
such a great snow storm," the recluse told them,
presently; "only I was anxious about this trap.
You see, I knew all about the ways of mink and
foxes, and also how they often gnaw a foot off
in order to get free. It would have given me a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bad feeling to come here and find that owing to
my delay, and the little animal's hunger, as well
as pain, it had done that same thing, and was
gone. The forepaw of a silver fox isn't worth
much, only to make the disappointed trapper say
things he'd be ashamed to have any one else
hear."</p>

<p>"Then we're all glad we got here in good time
to nip that little escape in the bud, Uncle," said
Toby.</p>

<p>"And as my cabin is more than a mile off, with
the going pretty poor, perhaps we'd better be setting
out for the same right away," remarked the
scientist. "I can give a pretty good guess that
you've been having some rough times, and will
be glad of a shelter to-night. As for myself, I'll
be happy indeed to have you with me. It does
get pretty lonely at times, even though I'm deeply
interested in my hobby of taking flashlight pictures
of the small animals hereabout. I've even
perfected an arrangement so that lots of times
they snap off their own pictures; as you'll see
later on when we get to work."</p>

<p>"We've only got a few days to spend up here
with you, Uncle Caleb," ventured Toby; "and we
must see all there is in a hurry. We've just
about got tired of roughing it in the snow, and a
change to cabin life will set us up again."</p>

<p>"Then let's start right away, if you boys think
you can hold out for lunch until we fetch up at
my place. The return journey shouldn't take
nearly as long as it did to come up here, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we can avoid plenty of pitfalls I fell into. How
about that plan, Toby?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you're ready, Uncle, let us know,"
replied the scout. "Can I carry the fox for you;
and how about this trap? Perhaps after catching
your prize you won't want to leave it around
again. If that's so let me take care of it for
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, from the looks of things, it seems to me
each one of you has enough to tote right now,"
chuckled the elderly man; "while I have nothing
except my rifle. I'm a pretty hardy sort of an
old chap, and able to carry my share of the burdens
still; so if you don't mind, Nephew Toby, I'll
look after both the trap and the silver fox."</p>

<p>Which he calmly proceeded to do; and they discovered
afterwards that Uncle Caleb had an iron
constitution, being able to do as much as any
grown-up of their acquaintance, possibly barring
the strong man of the circus, who could bend iron
bars across his knee, and allowed an anvil to be
pounded on his chest.</p>

<p>It appeared that Elmer had not been far out
of the way when he determined on the direction
from which they might expect the trapper to
come. His figuring this out on the merits of the
fact that their shots had not gone against the
wind, had a great deal to recommend it, as Uncle
Caleb admitted when he heard how scout tactics
had been employed.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to hear a whole lot more
about what Boy Scouts do," he told them, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
trudged cheerfully along; "and while we sit before
the fire evenings, you must explain everything
to me. From the little I know about it up
to date I'm inclined to believe they've at last gotten
hold of a very big idea, and one that's going
to be of far more lasting benefit to American boys
than any other scheme ever thought of in their
connection."</p>

<p>"And so far as I'm concerned, sir," replied
Elmer, modestly, "I'll be only too glad to give
you all the information I can scare up. Our folks
believe the same way you do, and as the Hickory
Ridge Troop of Boy Scouts has been working for
some few moons now, we feel that we've shown
what a great improvement belonging to the organization
has made in a good many fellows."</p>

<p>"Why, here's George for instance," said Lil
Artha, maliciously; "a short time ago his people
were worried because he didn't seem to eat half
enough; and now he wants the dinner bell to be
jangling all day long. That's one of the changes
it's made; and I could name others, sir, almost as
remarkable."</p>

<p>Even George himself had to join in the general
laugh this remark from the long-legged scout
brought out.</p>

<p>"I guess you're something of a joker, Arthur,"
observed Uncle Caleb, turning to smile at the
other.</p>

<p>"That's what they all say about me," complained
Lil Artha, "that I'm a joke, a freak; as
if I could help it that my legs grew at the expense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of my body. But so long as I have the brains to
go along with them why should I care whether
school keeps or not? What our scout master
doesn't tell you, we'll try and fill in; because there
are heaps of things connected with our trials and
victories of the past that Elmer might fight shy
of on account of a false modesty. We have to
blow his horn for him, you see, sir?"</p>

<p>"And I wager you blow it right well, too," observed
Uncle Caleb.</p>

<p>"Oh! I manage to get some kind of music out
of it, even if I'm not the regular bugler of the
troop. He's Mark Cummings, and he's away
from town right now. But how much further do
we have to go before we strike your shack, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not over a third of a mile at the most," came
the reassuring reply, that caused the tired boys to
pluck up new hope, and in a way gird themselves
afresh for the fray.</p>

<p>They had left the marsh behind long ago. Elmer
knew from this that its border could not be a
very desirable place to camp during the spring or
summer, when it was apt to be more or less overflowed,
and there was danger of malaria if one
persisted in sleeping with fogs abounding frequently
of nights.</p>

<p>Now that their troubles seemed all behind them,
some of the scouts could look about and even admire
the scenery by which they found themselves
surrounded. Elmer could at least, and he found
many interesting things to hold his attention as
they journeyed along, following in a general way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the trail which Uncle Caleb had made in coming
from his cabin to the spot where he had left the
fox trap, in hopes of snaring the silver black
which he knew used that section of the woods.</p>

<p>Every now and then their pilot would point out
some object that was associated with certain
events in the past. Here he had met with a black
bear unexpectedly, and managed to snap off a
picture of the surprised Bruin while the animal
reared up on his hind legs; and then retreated.
A little further on and he showed them where the
fire had once caught him in a trap; and how he
only escaped a serious singeing by discovering a
cleft among the rocks, where he managed to crawl
in, and lie until the danger was over. Then there
was the tree into which he had been chased by a
pack of wild dogs that seemed to have taken a
strange dislike for all human beings, and which
he had only dispersed after killing several of their
number.</p>

<p>All these things were especially interesting to
the scouts. They had met with not a few thrilling
like adventures in their own experience, during
their several camping trips to the woods;
though these might sound tame after hearing of
what strange happenings Uncle Caleb had experienced.</p>

<p>Toby saw that George raised his eyebrows each
time he heard some interesting narrative from
the recluse. He was a little afraid the doubter
might express himself in his usual skeptical fashion,
and demand further proof to back these tales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
up before he could give them unqualified approval;
but fortunately George had a little too
much good sense to commit such an indiscretion;
it might go all very well when dealing with boys
of his own age, but he did not have the nerve to
tell an elderly man, and a professor at that, he
doubted his word.</p>

<p>"He's got to be broken out of that bad habit,"
Toby was telling himself, every time he felt his
heart apparently in his throat with apprehension
lest George make a nuisance of himself; "and
seems to me his chums ought to be the ones to do
the thing up brown for George. What a nice fellow
he'd be if only it wasn't for his everlasting
sneering, and letting you feel he thought you
were bluffing him!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Elmer was studying Uncle Caleb.
He quickly came to the conclusion that he would
like the other very much indeed. He appeared to
be a wonderfully well-read man, with a fund of
information on every subject. Besides this, there
was a quizzical gleam in his eyes that told the
scout master the other was fond of humor, and
could enjoy a joke, providing it was not along the
lines of practical ones that hurt too deeply.</p>

<p>He was also a master of science, and no doubt
had made a name for himself long before he forsook
the haunts of men, to spend peaceful months
here in the wilderness, studying the ways of the
little creatures whose realm he had invaded.</p>

<p>Still, Uncle Caleb was a peaceful man. He
never claimed to be a sportsman, and would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
use his gun save as a means of absolute necessity,
if attacked by some dangerous wild beast; or else
as a means of procuring needed fresh meat, which
did not happen very often, since he was inclined
to be a vegetarian, and had all his supplies hauled
up here by wagon twice a year.</p>

<p>All these things Elmer learned by degrees, and
the more he came to know of this remarkable old
uncle of Toby's the better he liked him. This
business of "shooting" things with a snapshot
camera, especially by flashlight and at night-time,
had always appealed more or less to Elmer; and
he rejoiced to know that he was to be thrown in
the company of one who had been more or less
successful in obtaining wonderfully faithful pictures
of the small swamp and woods animals.</p>

<p>The boys soon began to cast anxious glances
ahead, for it was not very pleasant work carrying
all the stuff they had brought along with them to
the forest; and besides, the best part of the deer
Lil Artha had bagged so luckily for himself and
friends&mdash;particularly George.</p>

<p>"I don't see any sign of a cabin there, do you,
George?" Lil Artha remarked in an aside to the
other, who chanced to be puffing along at his
elbow, and grunting after his customary style,
though no more weary than the other three boys.</p>

<p>"No, and d'ye know I'm beginning to think
there may be no cabin after all, that's what," replied
George, stubbornly. "Of course Uncle
Caleb has one somewhere or other; but he may
have gotten mixed up in his bearings, you see;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and right now how do we know whether we're
heading right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't take the cake for seeing the
wrong side of everything," Lil Artha told him.
"Of course there's a cabin, and we must be getting
close to it as we stand now. About the old
gentleman making a blunder, and wandering off,
don't you know we've been following his out track
all the while. And say, what's that you can
glimpse through this little opening in the woods&mdash;in
a direct line with these two birch trees, tell
me that now, George, you old humbug of a grumbler?"</p>

<p>Thereupon George, only too willing to be convinced,
took a long look, and then slowly admitted
that he might have been too hasty.</p>

<p>"It does look a <i>little</i> like a shack roof, Lil Artha,
and p'raps I hadn't ought to have spoken like
I did; but even now that may be a fooler. Just
wait and let's make sure before we holler."</p>

<p>In another five minutes all doubt with regard
to this was ready to vanish even from that wavering
mind of George, because they could plainly
see one end of what seemed to be a pretty substantial
log cabin, with a broad chimney running
up the back, fashioned of slabs, and hardened mud
that no doubt resembled flint.</p>

<p>It seemed to be an ideal snug retreat for a man
who wanted to get away from the world, and enjoy
himself after his own fancy. Here Uncle
Caleb had come for years, and his visits to the
haunts of civilization had been few and far between.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
As time passed on they threatened to
cease altogether, for he found more real happiness
here than he could among mankind, struggling
constantly in pursuit of the mighty dollar,
and pushing others down in trying to climb.</p>

<p>"How do you like the looks of it?" asked the
owner of the cabin, with a touch of pardonable
pride in his voice; for he had gone to considerable
trouble in order to make the place attractive; and
even though mounds of snow covered everything
around, the boys could see that he had some conveniences,
such as ordinary loggers' camps could
hardly boast.</p>

<p>"It strikes me as a pretty sight," Elmer candidly
admitted; "and I don't blame you, sir, for
keeping up here. I should think you'd feel lonesome
sometimes, though?"</p>

<p>"I do, and used to have a friend spend part
of the season with me," acknowledged the scientist;
"but last fall he married, and went to Europe,
so that up to now I've been all alone, and
your coming will be doubly welcome as a break in
the monotony of the thing."</p>

<p>"But, Uncle, if as you say you are alone, who
could that have been I just saw at that little window?"
asked Toby.</p>

<p>"I certainly saw something moving inside
there, too," Lil Artha asserted, beginning to display
something of excitement, as he waited for
the other to explain what already began to take
on some of the elements of a dark mystery.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb looked earnestly at the window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
they mentioned. It was a small affair, and as
they afterwards discovered stood just above the
kitchen table, also used during meal-time, since it
was the only contrivance of its kind in the cabin.</p>

<p>"I don't happen to see anything there now,
boys," he went on to say; "but after all it
wouldn't surprise me very much. A very large
wildcat has been hovering near my cabin for a
week now. I've tried to get a picture of the beast
several times, but all I managed to secure has
been a rolling ball of fur for one, two glaring eyes
for another, and the end of a stubby tail for a
third. Now, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if that
smart old cat has been watching me, and saw when
I went off some time ago. Prowling around it
must have climbed on the roof, and then finding
it could back down the throat of the chimney,
that's what he's done."</p>

<p>"Whoop!" cried Lil Artha, "a wildcat in possession,
and has to be kicked out before we can
use those bunks. Get your gun ready, Elmer, and
we'll ambush the sinner."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CHIMNEY JUMPER</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hold</span> on, Lil Artha, don't rush things so
fast!" called out Toby.</p>

<p>"Because this isn't our cabin, and before you
knock over the uninvited guest it might be just as
well to ask permission from the owner," added
Elmer.</p>

<p>All eyes were of course turned on Uncle Caleb,
although, according to the mind of the impulsive
Lil Artha, there was only one thing that could be
done, which was to suddenly open the door, and
when the wildcat rushed out give him a shot.</p>

<p>"I've been trying to get a picture of that cat so
long," Uncle Caleb told them, "that I'd really be
very much disappointed now if he met with his
fate, and I had to go without a snapshot, even
though a distant one, to remember him by."</p>

<p>"It might be arranged," suggested Elmer,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Put your trust in our scout master, sir, and
you won't be disappointed," Lil Artha went on
to say, meanwhile looking curiously toward Elmer,
as though wondering what sort of plan he could
have conceived on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>"Tell us how, Elmer?" George demanded, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the same time eying the cabin with a dubious manner,
as though he half believed the boys who said
they had seen <i>something</i> through the small window
must have deceived themselves.</p>

<p>"Why, if the beast came down through the chimney,
it strikes me he ought to know enough to go
out the same way if alarmed enough," was what
Elmer told them.</p>

<p>"A good idea, my boy!" declared Uncle Caleb,
"and if I had everything ready, with my little
pocket camera focussed on the chimney, I suppose
I could snap him off as he climbed out. Now I'll
fix that up right away, and when I'm ready I'll
sing out. After that some of you can bang on the
door, and start shouting, which should be enough
to alarm the cat and make it think of scampering
out the way it came in."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. Pushing forward
until he was within thirty feet of the cabin, with a
good view of the rude chimney-top, and the light
in the right quarter to promise a good picture,
Uncle Caleb waved his hand to the others.</p>

<p>"All ready here, boys!" he exclaimed after he
had fixed himself.</p>

<p>Elmer had spoken to Lil Artha and Toby, who
were delegated to be the attacking squad. George
and the scout master accompanied Uncle Caleb,
the latter holding his gun in readiness.</p>

<p>"Remember," said Elmer, in a tone that every
one could easily hear, "there is to be no shooting
unless it becomes necessary. If the cat attacks
us we'll have to defend ourselves. If it chooses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to go about its business we don't expect to bother
it any. Get that, Lil Artha?"</p>

<p>The tall scout replied that he did, though he
looked disappointed, as though this thing of sparing
so ferocious a varmint as a wildcat just because
some one wanted to catch a few pictures of
the beast from time to time, did not appeal very
much to his sense of the fitness of things. To Lil
Artha the cat was without the pale of the law, because
it destroyed all sorts of useful things, from
young partridges, rabbits and squirrels to domestic
fowls; and he knew there never was a time that
any State in the Union ever attempted to bar its
hunters from killing every bobcat they could find,
the more the merrier.</p>

<p>"Then start your racket!" Elmer told the two
who were standing close to the cabin door.</p>

<p>Upon thus getting orders Lil Artha and Toby
began to immediately make all the noise they
could. They pounded on the door with their fists,
together with the butt end of Lil Artha's gun; and
the jargon of talk they put up was enough to drive
any ordinary cat distracted.</p>

<p>Toby even partly opened the door&mdash;just a few
inches for he did not want to make the acquaintance
of that cat at close quarters&mdash;and banged it
shut again, meanwhile sending a whoop through
the slit. It must have been a brave animal that
could have stood out against all that combination
of sounds.</p>

<p>Through the small opening Toby had glimpsed
something that made him have a chilly sensation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
along the region of his spine. He had caught sight
of the intruder. The cat was an exceptionally
large one, and it stood there in the middle of the
floor, its hair bristling with fury, and its eyes glaring
like yellow balls. No wonder Toby slammed
that door so speedily, while his whoop ended in a
yell. He almost thought he could hear the heavy
thud as the springing cat landed against the door
close to his head.</p>

<p>That may have only been his imagination working
overtime, and inspired by the one glimpse he
had obtained of the fierce beast. He fancied as
much himself later on, when in a condition to survey
the sequence of events calmly.</p>

<p>While Toby and Lil Artha continued to whoop
things up another shrill outcry, this time from
George, stilled their clamor.</p>

<p>"Oh! there he is coming out of the chimney,
Elmer!" was what George shrieked in his excitement,
and afterwards the others laughed when
they made mention of the fact that for once
George did not seem to doubt the evidence of his
eyes, or say that he thought it might be the cat he
saw.</p>

<p>"I've got him!" added Uncle Caleb, who doubtless
must have managed to work his snapshot
camera instantly, though no one heard the "click"
of the flying shutter on account of all the other
sounds that were arising.</p>

<p>The wildcat had indeed appeared on top of the
chimney, having remembered the route it had
taken when entering. This alone proved that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was a clever beast, because in the midst of such
excitement many another animal would have lost
its head, and gone plunging around the interior,
trying to push through the window perhaps, and
utterly forgetting that there was such a thing as a
vent in that slab and hard mud "smoke chaser,"
as Lil Artha always called the chimney.</p>

<p>"Look out, Elmer, he's going to jump at you!"
warned the tall scout, in a frenzied tone.</p>

<p>A wildcat is possibly one of the most vicious of
small beasts of prey to be found in American
forests. It will often attack a hunter without any
seeming provocation, although doubtless there is
some reason for the reckless act, such as hidden
kittens near by, or consuming hunger.</p>

<p>In this particular case neither of these reasons
would apply, but the animal was enraged on account
of being disturbed while eating, and then
badgered by those yells on the part of the two
scouts, as well as their banging of the cabin door.
George afterwards told them that they could
hardly blame the poor cat for getting its back up
when abused and shouted at in such a way; he also
said that if he happened to be a wild beast he
would certainly be "mad clear through, and ready
to fight at the drop of the hat."</p>

<p>Elmer was on the alert, not that he had really
anticipated such a thing as having the wildcat
spring at him, but he knew enough about such animals
to be aware of their fickle temper, and that
one is never to be trusted within leaping range.
An old hunter had once told him never under any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
possibility to lower his gun when a bobcat was facing
him, because their spring is like a flash of
lightning. And as we happen to know, Elmer was
a boy who always believed in the efficiency of the
scout's motto, "Be Prepared!"</p>

<p>The cat crouched there on the top of the chimney
for just three seconds. That was the time
when Uncle Caleb managed to press the button,
and get his picture. It was also when Lil Artha
sent out his shrill warning, and at the same time
swung his Marlin gun around so that the stock
rested against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the wildcat sprang, with every powerful
muscle in play&mdash;sprang straight toward the little
group of three&mdash;George, Elmer and Uncle Caleb!</p>

<p>George was unarmed and being a cautious fellow
he knew that the best thing for him to do was
to get out of range as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>Accordingly his movement was exactly timed
with that of the leaping cat; for just as the animal
quitted the apex of the short chimney, and
launched its agile body into the air, George fell
flat on his face on the ground and made himself
as small as possible.</p>

<p>There sounded a double report. Both Elmer
and Lil Artha had fired so near the same time that
until told differently later on, George supposed
that the scout master alone had made use of his
ready gun.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb knew considerable about these savage
cats, and he jumped aside even as the roar of
the guns sounded. Elmer, too, had no sooner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pulled the trigger than he took a quick step to the
right, and then held his gun ready to make use of
the other barrel if necessary.</p>

<p>It turned out that such a thing was not needed.
Halted in midair by the double charge of shot,
which at such close range must have had the same
tearing effect as so many bullets, the wildcat fell
with a heavy thud to the ground, some five feet
away from where Elmer stood. He instantly
covered the beast with his gun.</p>

<p>"No need of another shot, my boy!" cried the
owner of the cabin, hastily; "you've already settled
him handsomely."</p>

<p>The wretched invader had indeed paid the penalty
for his crimes, and all because he possessed
such a terrible temper. Had he been willing to
jump in the other direction the chances were
nothing would have been done to prevent his escape,
so that he might furnish Uncle Caleb with
other opportunities to snap him off when in the
act perhaps of devouring a partridge he had captured
in the snow forest. When he allowed his
fury to get the better of his discretion he made the
one mistake of his life.</p>

<p>All of them gathered around the now dead wildcat
to admire his size, and comment on his recklessness
in daring to attack a party of human
beings.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of such nerve in all your
life?" remarked Lil Artha, who was grinning all
over with the satisfaction it gave him to be instrumental
in disposing of such a pest of the woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"Why, if there had been a regiment I reckon he'd
have jumped at 'em just the same. Mebbe cats
go mad sometimes, and just don't know what
they're doing."</p>

<p>"I've known of similar cases before," remarked
Uncle Caleb, who was looking at the wretched
beast rather sadly, Elmer thought, "and a hunter
who has had experience never trusts a cat further
than he can see it. They get those crazy freaks
once in a while, and fear seems to be driven out of
their system. When a Malay or a Chinaman
loses his head, and starts to wipe out the whole
town, they say he is 'running amuck,' and they
always shoot him down as they would a mad dog.
This cat species when rendered furious does the
same thing, and hesitates at nothing. But I'm
sorry it had to be done. He was a splendid specimen
of a wildcat. Look at those powerful muscles,
and see what a square head he has. I'd have
given considerable to have had him a little more
sociable, so that I might have snapped off several
pictures showing how he secured his food, and
crept up on game. But it couldn't be helped, apparently;
he just had to go and commit suicide as
it seemed. And, Elmer, you certainly pulled a
quick trigger."</p>

<p>"Half the credit goes to Lil Artha, for he fired
at the same time," Elmer quickly admitted. "I'm
sure both of us hit him, because you can see how
badly the pelt is cut up. It would never bring
ten cents in the market after that riddling."</p>

<p>"Is it possible that there were two shots, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I never suspected it?" Uncle Caleb observed,
turning on the tall scout with a smile. "Well, I
can easily see that you boys have long ago learned
how to take care of yourselves, which is one of the
best things any lad can know. All of which increases
my desire to hear more about this organization
that is doing such wonders for our
American lads."</p>

<p>"Do you think you got your picture of the cat,
Uncle?" asked Toby. "I heard you call out
something or other about it."</p>

<p>"I pressed the button while he was squatting
on the top of the chimney," the owner of the
cabin went on to say, "and that should be a fine
picture. Then almost mechanically I turned the
screw that brought another section of film into
play, and my recollection is that I snapped off
another shot even as the beast was in the air.
I'm curious to know if I got anything worth while
with that one. It would be a great triumph if I
should develop the film and find that I'd caught
the cat just as it received your shots and crumpled
up in midair."</p>

<p>"That would be something worth seeing, sir,"
Lil Artha told him, "and we'll hope it turns out
that way."</p>

<p>George had scrambled to his feet as soon as he
realized that the danger was over. He looked a
little ashamed, but there was no occasion for feeling
that way. When any one is unarmed, and
sees such a fury as that wildcat certainly was
coming in his direction, he would be foolish indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
not to dodge, and even hug the ground in an effort
to escape contact with those cruel poisonous claws.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! look at the sharp teeth, would you;
and then those open claws," Lil Artha continued,
as he bent down and took one of the dead cat's
feet in his fingers; "excuse me from meeting up
with such a crazy customer when walking through
the woods at sundown. I might manage to get
the best of the beast, but my bully khaki suit would
be in ribbons, and mebbe my face clawed into a
map of Ireland."</p>

<p>"As for me," spoke up Toby, "I'd never feel
easy if I knew such a terror was always hanging
around, watching for a chance to grab me when
my back was turned. And say what you will,
Uncle Caleb, I'm tickled half to death because we
bagged your pet cat before he had a chance to
mark any of us. I tell you I'll enjoy my tramps
around this section better after this. If he'd got
away you wouldn't have caught Tobias Ellsworth
Jones wandering fifty feet away from home base
without carrying a club or a gun along. His room
is going to be a whole sight better than his company."</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb smiled at hearing what his nephew
thought.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right in saying that, Toby,"
he remarked, "and it may be that in pursuing my
pet hobby I'm going too much to extremes in wanting
to preserve the life of such a savage animal.
Possibly your ending his career of piracy may be
the means of saving me from a very unpleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
experience; for I was planning to push my campaign
against this same cat, and follow him into
his den, to get a good flashlight picture of what he
looked like at home. It would have been a foolhardy
experiment, I begin to realize. I suppose
it's all for the best, and I'll cure the skin just to
remember the adventure by."</p>

<p>Lil Artha, who had pushed up close to Elmer,
managed to say in a low tone:</p>

<p>"I reckon that it was you knocked the stuffing
out of the beast, Elmer, because I'm afraid I fired
too low." But the scout master immediately
hushed him up, and told him never to mention it
again, for he felt sure both of them had made a
hit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SCOUTS IN CLOVER</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> used to be a time," Uncle Caleb went
on to remark, as he lifted the heavy wildcat, and
started toward the door of his cabin, "when I was
considered quite a sportsman. I took every opportunity
I could to be in the woods and on the
water, shooting deer, quail, partridge, snipe,
ducks, geese, brant and all such things, for my
fancy seemed to run more in the line of small
game than grizzly bears or lions, tigers, elephants
and the like. But years ago I began to notice a
change gradually taking place in my feelings. I
suppose many men find the same thing working
when they grow older, and the fires of youth are
spent. I began to dislike taking life of any sort,
and recently I have allowed many a fine chance to
make a bag slip by, because I would sooner snap
off a picture, and live on canned goods supplied
from the store."</p>

<p>Of course none of the boys could fully understand
this sentiment. They viewed it from the
standpoint of youth, and would never know any
different until they too grew old, and their hunting
instincts became mellowed.</p>

<p>At the same time they could respect such humane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
motives, and understand something of the
peculiar fascination that taking pictures of wild
animals in their native haunts was apt to entail.</p>

<p>"Now to see what a mess the creature may have
made of my little cabin home," Uncle Caleb went
on to say, as he flung open the door and entered,
leaving the body of the late trespasser outside
to be attended to later.</p>

<p>The scouts crowded in after him, and looked
eagerly around. They found that the cabin in the
snow forest was quite a neat affair. Evidently
the occupant had gone to considerable trouble and
expense to make it comfortable. As he expected
to spend most of his time here under this roof,
Uncle Caleb believed in having things to suit him,
even to a little bathroom off the back, which in
summer was supplied with running water from a
spring on higher ground, and fed through a
sunken pipe, now disconnected on account of the
freezing temperature that would have speedily
burst it.</p>

<p>There were a couple of bunks built into the
walls on either side of the big fireplace, which latter
came out several feet into the room. Besides
this there was a cot that was also a settee in the
daytime, a large table, several comfortable seats
that were along the type of the Morris chair Elmer
had in his den at home, and various cases of
books, curiosities and such things.</p>

<p>Upon the floor were a number of real imported
small rugs that Uncle Caleb must have brought
from the Orient himself. The boys thought them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rather odd, though at the same time pretty; but
they were later on staggered when they learned
the history of each little carpet, and what a vast
sum Uncle Caleb had paid for them in his r&ocirc;le of
collector.</p>

<p>Taken in all, the interior of that cabin was
about as far from resembling the average hunter's
home as anything could be. Immediately Lil
Artha quit calling it the "shack," because forever
afterwards with that cheery interior it would appeal
more to him in the garb of a miniature
palace.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb was a rich bachelor, and he liked
to be comfortable. Besides, he was a man of
science, and a student, rather than a hunter; so
they concluded that he was quite right in making
his little home look so pleasant.</p>

<p>Just then, however, things were in something
of an upset condition. The hungry cat in prowling
around and searching for something to eat
had upset a number of articles, broken a pet dish
of the cabin's owner; while there on the table was
the partly gnawed strip of bacon at which the
animal had been busily at work when interrupted
by their arrival on the scene.</p>

<p>"I can save the better part of it," said the
easy-going Uncle Caleb, "and besides, there is
plenty more in the locker, for I lay in my winter's
stock long before the first real snow comes, so as
not to be bothered later on by trips to the town
where I trade, which is many miles away from
here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>When later on he showed them his "strong
room" where his stores were kept George in particular
was noticed to lick his lips with a satisfied
smile on his face as if telling himself that there
need be no fear of hunger so long as they stayed
with Uncle Caleb.</p>

<p>"Choose your bunks, boys," they were speedily
told, "and toss your blankets in the ones you
select. It seems that you figured pretty closely,
because if there had been another scout in the
party we'd have had to get busy building a new
bed. As it is, there is one apiece all around."</p>

<p>"But how about you, Uncle?" asked Toby,
solicitously; "we don't want to push you out of
your regular bed. Let me sleep on that cot."</p>

<p>"No, I prefer to take it," the owner of the cabin
replied; "in fact, as a rule I have slept on the cot
winters, because I can pull it up in front of the
fire on nights that are particularly bitter."</p>

<p>"You must get some howlers up here, sir, I
should think," suggested Elmer.</p>

<p>"Along in January we often have a terrible
storm or blizzard, when it's utterly unsafe to venture
outside the door, because one can never see
ten feet away. Men have been found frozen to
death close to their own cabins, which they did not
dream were so close by when they gave up in
despair. The storm that just visited us was
pretty severe, but not to be compared with some
I have seen."</p>

<p>"George, take your pick of bunks," said Elmer.</p>

<p>Perhaps he allowed George to have the first say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
because of the other's notorious habit of grumbling;
the wise scout master did not want to give
him any chance to complain that he had not been
treated fairly and squarely.</p>

<p>Now George was not so greedy but that he could
feel ashamed. He seemed to scent the true reason
why Elmer was so kind, for a flush came over his
face, and he actually shook his head in a decided
negative.</p>

<p>"That isn't just fair to the rest, Elmer, and I
won't have it," he said, with a show of spirit.
"The bunks are all built alike, but one may be
better than the others, 'specially of a cold night.
Now I tell you how we'll fix that up fine and
dandy; I'll mark them by numbers up to four;
then I'll write that many on pieces of paper and
we'll put them in a hat. Each one draws one
out, and in that way gets his bunk without any
favoritism being shown. What d'ye say to that,
Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Just as you like, George; and I want to tell
you I admire the independent spirit you display
when you refuse to be favored above the rest.
That's the right way to show what you're made
of. It speaks well for the regard you have toward
others."</p>

<p>While Elmer was saying this George drew out a
lead pencil stub and made a figure on the front of
each bunk, running from one to four. Then he
did the little numbering on as many small squares
of paper torn from his notebook. These latter he
threw into a hat and held it so no one could look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in, though a hand might be inserted through the
small opening.</p>

<p>"Elmer, you draw first!" George went on to
say, as he held the hat out to each one of the others
in turn.</p>

<p>So the scout master accommodated him, and
found that he had hit upon one of the lower bunks.
Toby got the upper, and Lil Artha drew the other
elevated bed; so that after all George was given
the pick of the lot. No one could ever begrudge
him his good luck, now that he had shown such a
fair spirit.</p>

<p>"It hit me about right," admitted Lil Artha, as
he stood up alongside the wall, and flung his blanket
inside the second upper bunk, "because Nature
always intended that I should nest high, when She
gave me this pair of stilts. Lucky you made the
bunks over six feet long, Uncle Caleb, or I'd never
have been able to turn over without drawing my
knees up to my chin. It gives me a pain whenever
I think that I may go on stretching out for
nearly four years yet. My folks think of cutting
the doors higher in our house. They get tired
of seeing me duck my head every time I come into
a room."</p>

<p>A fire was soon built up in the open space under
the chimney flue which the cunning wildcat had
used as a means for entering and leaving the
cabin. At the time there happened to be little
heat among the ashes, for the owner was averse
to leaving a fire when he went away for hours,
lest he return only to find a blackened heap where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
his cabin with its many precious treasures had
stood.</p>

<p>It was like a picnic to cook when there were so
many conveniences, and Lil Artha, who insisted
on helping George, called attention to the excellent
iron frame which was intended to be placed
over the fire, and serve to hold such cooking vessels
as were needed in the preparation of the meal.</p>

<p>Besides this there was a portable oven which
made splendid biscuits and bread, as the boys
learned later on, when Uncle Caleb showed them
how he lived while keeping bachelor's hall alone
in that wilderness, days, weeks and months at a
time. He had a small barrel of flour in his storeroom,
with such a collection of canned goods and
dried as well as smoked meats, that George declared
it looked like a young grocery store to him;
and privately admitted that he would not care
very much if they had been booked to stay the balance
of the winter with Uncle Caleb, instead of
just a few days. He could see all manner of
"good times" in that delightful storeroom collection.</p>

<p>They had a light lunch, as the old scientist usually
preferred to eat his one heavy meal in the
evening, after his thinking was done for the day.</p>

<p>"Make yourselves quite at home, boys," he told
them, with a sincerity that even skeptical George
could not question; "everything I have is at your
disposal. You will find hosts of things to interest
you among my collection of curios, and the
myriads of pictures I have taken the last seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
years. Some of them have been honored by being
published in a geographic magazine, and excited
considerable interest among a certain class of scientists.
I'm ready to answer every question you
can ask, and it will give me the greatest pleasure
imaginable to be of service to you. All I seek in
return is full confidence; you must tell me all
about what scouts do, and learn, and aim to accomplish;
also what adventures you may have encountered
in carrying out these organization
principles."</p>

<p>During the rest of that never-to-be-forgotten
afternoon the boys manifested no desire to wander
through the white forest, but stayed indoors looking
at the many interesting things owned by Uncle
Caleb, many of which he had picked up in various
quarters and corners of the world, for he had been
a famous traveler in his day.</p>

<p>They almost talked themselves hoarse, asking
questions, and explaining all about what duties
and obligations a boy takes upon his shoulders
when he subscribes to the scout promise, and assumes
the responsibilities accompanying such a
service.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb had about everything that money
could purchase in connection with his photographic
fad; and among other things a daylight
tank for developing the films.</p>

<p>As he was very anxious to find out whether the
snapshots taken of the wildcat on the cabin chimney
would turn out to be worth anything, he proceeded
to develope the films that afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>When he held them up after washing, and let
the boys see the result they were loud in their
declarations that he had really done himself proud.</p>

<p>There was the one with the big cat crouching on
the chimney-top, and giving all the detail that
could be desired. The other was not quite so
clear, but it seemed that he must have aimed the
camera just right, and pressed the button while
the leaping animal was in midair, just crumpling
up under the two charges of shot received from
separate quarters. This last was a thrilling picture,
and ought to make a fine print.</p>

<p>"They'll be a splendid addition to my collection,"
Uncle Caleb told the boys, as he surveyed
his prizes with kindling eyes; "I've got a good
many strange pictures but I expect these will top
the list. I'll print a copy for each one of you to
carry home when you go, because in a measure
that is your cat, as well as mine."</p>

<p>Taken in all, they would never be apt to forget
that same afternoon. Their genial host seemed to
be so delighted to have such a wideawake pack of
boys up there with him, that he could not do too
much for them. Many were the yarns he spun
connected with his nomadic life under different
suns; and since settling down to this peculiar state
of existence he had known a multitude of adventures,
both great and small.</p>

<p>"Right now," he told them, as the afternoon
light began to fade with the drawing near of the
time for sunset, "you might say I am a marked
man; not that it gives me any great amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
concern, because I hardly believe that Zack Arnold
will ever get his courage up to the sticking
point, and attempt to carry out the wild threats he
made against me."</p>

<p>"I remember hearing a man speaking that name
on the train when we were nearing your station,
Uncle!" exclaimed Toby; "he talked as though
the fellow might be a sort of woods guide, though
a tough rascal feared by every one, even the game
wardens, who were afraid to try and arrest him
for shooting game out of season."</p>

<p>"All of which is about as true as it can be," was
the reply. "Six months ago I had the misfortune
to run foul of this same Zack. He was even then
half under the influence of liquor, and very abusive.
I could have stood it for myself, but when
the big brute raised his hand, and knocked down
a half-grown girl who had chanced to stumble, and
fall against him, in the store, it was too much for
my blood."</p>

<p>"You gave him what he deserved, didn't you,
Uncle?" demanded the exultant Toby.</p>

<p>"Well, I knocked him down three times in succession,
for he had come at me with a knife the
second and third times. After that he lay there,
and was counted out. Now I was never proud of
having upset a brawling bully like that when half-seas
over, but it had to be done to pay him for
striking that poor child. I heard afterwards that
he was furious at me, and vowed he would get
even, if he had to come all the way up here to
where I held out, and settle his debt."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys exchanged looks.</p>

<p>"But he might take a sudden notion to visit
you, when feeling in a particularly ugly mood,
Uncle," Toby remarked, soberly, "and no one
would ever know who had set your cabin on fire,
and perhaps burned you in the same."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought of that and for a time never
went outside these walls without carrying a gun
along; but months have passed, and he does not
show up, which I take it means he is too big a
coward to risk his ears trying to do me an ill turn.
And of late I've neglected any of those precautions.
When first I saw my fox trap had been
tampered with, and that valuable prize taken, I
thought of what Zack Arnold had sworn, and was
sure it must be his work. But let's forget about
such an unpleasant subject, and have a little music
for a change."</p>

<p>It seemed that among his many other accomplishments
Uncle Caleb was something of a musician;
that is, he loved music, and could play very
well on a banjo, as well as on a guitar. The boys
had found this out, through Toby, and looked forward
to having good times listening to their genial
host during evenings, as they sat before a crackling
fire, and cared not for the weather without.</p>

<p>It was getting pretty sharp again, as George
announced after coming in with an armful of
wood; but little they cared, with such comfortable
quarters, and plenty to eat in the family cupboard.</p>

<p>As if to dismiss an unpleasant subject from his
mind Uncle Caleb started in to amuse his young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
guests with various popular selections, most of
which the scouts knew as well as they did their
own names. From these he presently drifted to
older airs from the operas, and sentimental serenades
that afforded the boys considerable pleasure.
In the end he played a few such favorites
as "Home, Sweet Home," with so much effect
that he had one or two of them secretly winking
rapidly in order to keep the tears from filling their
eyes.</p>

<p>"Come, we've had enough of this for the present,"
said the player, suddenly, on catching sight
of Toby blowing his nose with great vehemence,
"and as it's getting dark outside, suppose we start
our preparations for supper. I've got a few
wrinkles I'd like to show you, although I rather
expect some of you boys will turn out such good
cooks that you'll make my little efforts look primitive."</p>

<p>All the same they did not. Uncle Caleb excelled
in nearly everything he undertook, from science,
music, and photographing wild animals in their
native haunts, all the way down to cookery&mdash;perhaps
George and Toby and Lil Arthur might object
to using that word, and on their own account
say "<i>up</i> to cookery."</p>

<p>At any rate he certainly gave the scouts a supper
they would not soon forget; and they admitted
in private afterwards that they must look to their
laurels if they did not want to be considered "back
numbers." Uncle Caleb had done his own cooking
for a good many years, and being of an investigating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
turn of mind, had not been content to go
along beaten paths, like most bachelors left to
their own devices, but had studied cook-books, and
made a success of many fine recipes.</p>

<p>After the meal was over, and things cleaned up,
they gathered before the burning logs, and looked
forward to an enjoyable evening. Every one was
to have a part in entertaining the company, with
story or song, as the case might be; and Elmer
had a long list of questions which he wanted
answers for, mostly pertaining to the habits of the
little woods and swamps animals in which Uncle
Caleb had become so vitally interested.</p>

<p>Before they could get fully settled down, however,
there was a shuffling sound heard at the
door, and then came a hesitating sort of knock
from without.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE OBJECT LESSON</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Wasn't</span> that a knock?" asked George, who
apparently had not heard the sound so plainly as
the others.</p>

<p>"Seemed like it to me," replied Toby, "but say,
neighbors can't be so plenty up here in the woods,
to have one running in after supper for enough
coffee to last over breakfast. P'raps, after all, it
was only a limb scraping against the roof; or a
squirrel up in the loft huntin' nuts Uncle's laid
away."</p>

<p>"It is some one at the door!" remarked the
owner of the cabin, quietly.</p>

<p>Elmer saw him getting to his feet. There was a
sparkle in the eyes of Uncle Caleb; and his jaw
seemed set in a determined way. This suddenly
caused Elmer to remember what had been recently
told about the tough hard-drinking guide who
believed he had a grudge against the old scientist&mdash;Uncle
Caleb.</p>

<p>"Let me go to the door for you, Uncle Caleb,"
said Elmer, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"It is my cabin, son, and therefore my duty to
answer any summons," was the steady reply of
the old gentleman; "so please stay where you are,
unless I need any assistance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great governor! what if it should be <i>that
man?</i>" Lil Artha was heard to mutter as he
reached out a hand, and clutched his own Marlin,
which chanced to be standing in a corner conveniently
near by.</p>

<p>Every one fairly held his breath as Uncle Caleb
was seen to move toward the door. He had not
thought it worth while to arm himself, and Elmer
considered this positive evidence, going to prove
the other's bravery. He himself hardly knew
what to expect, and his whole frame fairly quivered
with a mixture of eagerness and dread as
he saw the owner of the cabin start to open the
door, which had been secured by a simple old-fashioned
bar that fell into a brace of sockets,
one on either side.</p>

<p>Immediately the barrier was removed they saw
a figure stagger into view. Uncle Caleb stretched
out his hand, and took hold of it. Then the sound
of muttered words came to their ears, after which
the old gentleman turned, closed the door, and led
his unexpected guest toward the fire.</p>

<p>The staring scouts saw that this was a very
large man. He seemed to be coarsely dressed as
might a woods guide, wearing a heavy sweater
under his outer coat. No weapons were visible,
and one of his arms hung limply at his side as
though it might have been broken in some sort of
accident.</p>

<p>The man's face was distorted by pain, but they
could see that it was bearded, and looked bearish.
In fact, every one of the boys' first impression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was that they would not care to meet this fellow
while wandering through some lonely part of the
forest, and do anything calculated to excite his
anger; for he appeared to be a man with a violent
temper.</p>

<p>"It's <i>him</i>, I just bet you, Elmer!" whispered
Lil Artha in the scout master's ear and Elmer
nodded as though he fully agreed with the other.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no need to mention names,
for the memory of what Uncle Caleb had recently
told them was fresh in every fellow's mind. Curiously
they watched what was going on. Lil Artha
still caressed his gun. He had hardly made up
his mind whether or not this might be a clever
trick on the part of Zack Arnold, calculated to
gain him an entrance to the cabin of the man he
hated so bitterly, though without any reasonably
just cause.</p>

<p>It was only the other day that Lil Artha had
been reading in school of the wooden horse which
played such an important part in the capture of
Troy in olden times, being filled with the enemy,
who, issuing forth in the night-time, opened the
gates of the fortified city to their allies without.
Perhaps that was what made the boy suspect the
visitor might be shamming in order to catch Uncle
Caleb off his guard.</p>

<p>But if this idea had seized hold of Lil Artha he
soon realized its utter absurdity. Men may go to
considerable lengths in order to carry out their
schemes; but he certainly did not believe even a
determined fellow like Zack Arnold would deliberately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
break his arm in the effort to divert suspicion.</p>

<p>It was an ugly break, too, as was shown as soon
as Uncle Caleb had divested the other of his garments,
with the assistance of Elmer, who sprang
to his side when he realized what was needed.
That thick, hairy arm was covered with blood, and
the sight of it made Toby and George shudder.</p>

<p>"Get a kettle of water on the fire in a hurry,
please!" said Uncle Caleb, "because the first thing
to be done is to wash this arm so we can see how
to set the bone. Toby, at the same time start that
coffee to going again, will you? A few hot drinks
would take some of the chill out of this poor fellow.
He's had a terrible tumble, and is covered
with bruises, besides this broken arm. But we'll
fix him up as comfortable as we can; and he luckily
managed to get to my cabin before it was too
late!"</p>

<p>While the old gentleman was speaking in this
way the keen black eyes of Zack Arnold kept following
his every move. Elmer wondered what
must be passing through the mind of the vindictive
man just then. He did not doubt in the least
but what some terrible plan to revenge himself
upon Uncle Caleb for what the other had done to
him on that previous occasion had been the cause
for his coming to this particular region, for his
own camping grounds lay many miles away to the
west, where sportsmen congregated in the season
for either fly fishing or deer hunting.</p>

<p>With some black plan in his mind the man had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
started to even up his score with Uncle Caleb;
but a strange fate had caused him to meet with a
terrible accident; and now he was compelled to
actually seek shelter and assistance from the very
man he had been about to injure.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable freak of fate, and Elmer
found himself wondering what the outcome of it
all might be.</p>

<p>Lil Artha had quietly replaced his Marlin in the
corner when he first glimpsed that tortured arm,
for he realized then that there was going to be no
need of weapons. When Uncle Caleb called for a
kettle of warm water he was the first to leap to
his feet and place one on the fire; while Toby, just
as eager to help, began to brew the coffee.</p>

<p>This latter was ready even before the kettle
began to sing, and Uncle Caleb himself poured a
brimming cup of the beverage, which he handed
to the wounded man. No doubt Zack Arnold
needed some stimulant the worst kind. He must
have exhausted his pet flask on the way, for he did
not seem to have a drop about him; and when the
fragrant Java beverage was placed in his possession
he swallowed the contents of the big aluminum
cup in great gulps, as though his throat might be
made of cast iron, which no hot stuff could scald.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb asked no questions. He must know
very well what had brought this revengeful guide
so far out of his beaten track; but to see him tenderly
washing that arm, and then gently setting
the broken bones, after which he bound it up with
a splint almost as well as any professional surgeon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
could, you might have thought he was attending
his best friend instead of a bitter enemy.</p>

<p>Lil Artha could hardly keep his eyes off the
man's face. He, too, had finally managed to grasp
the same idea that had come long before to Elmer;
and now he wondered again and again what the
outcome of this remarkable adventure was going
to be. He even chuckled a little to himself as he
saw those eyes of Zack following Uncle Caleb back
and forth, as the other went to get more bandages,
or it might be the soothing salve which he wished
to rub upon several ugly black-and-blue spots
visible on the left side of the brawny woodsman.</p>

<p>"Huh! I've heard before about heaping coals
of fire on your enemy's head," Lil Artha whispered
to Elmer, when he found a good chance,
"but I never just understood what it meant. Now
I know to a fraction. Say, did you ever hear of
such a queer thing in all your life? And I bet you
he was coming up here to make a lot of trouble
for Toby's uncle, too. Well, this <i>is</i> an object lesson
for scouts, ain't it, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Lil Artha, but better not try
and talk any more about it. He might hear something
you wouldn't want him to. Just keep your
eyes and ears open, and you'll be well paid."</p>

<p>So after that the tall scout sat still and kept on
the alert. He was enjoying things exceedingly.
In fact he could not remember having ever felt
such a keen interest in anything before as he did
in this coming of Zack Arnold to the cabin of his
hated enemy, and under such queer conditions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>When in the end Uncle Caleb finished attending
to his injured guest, and with the help of Elmer
the guide's sweater had been secured in such
fashion that it gave him the required warmth, he
seemed to remember something else looking to the
comfort of Zack Arnold.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could manage to eat something
if we cooked it for you, Zack?" he asked,
with such an earnest manner that the man writhed
in his seat, and his eyes fell in what Lil Artha
believed to be utter shame, though he quickly
spoke up in reply.</p>

<p>"Ye've made me feel so comfy-like, suh, that I
jest reckon I <i>could</i> take a few bites. Hain't had
nawthin' sence mornin'. Ye see, I took this tumble
'long 'bout noon, an' I lost nigh everything I
had with me in the way o' eatin's an' same with
the drinkin's. Been jest walkin' ever sence, ahopin'
I mout hold out long enuff ter strike yer shack;
but I kim near throwin' up the sponge an' lettin'
the freeze do the bizness for me."</p>

<p>George saw a chance to get his hand in had
come at last.</p>

<p>"What shall I cook him, Uncle Caleb!" he hastened
to ask.</p>

<p>"I've got just two eggs left from the lot I
fetched back with me," said the old scientist, without
hesitation, "and you can fry them for him
with a slice of ham. You'll find the eggs in that
can where I keep my rice, the one with the name
on the front, George. And there's plenty more
coffee in the pot. In his present exhausted condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it will be the best thing he can take, far better
than liquor!"</p>

<p>The guide opened his mouth as though about to
say something, but his emotions must have overcome
him, for he gulped several times, blinked his
eyes quickly, and then sat there staring hard at
the fire, possibly with strange thoughts surging
through his mind.</p>

<p>Elmer noted these things. He felt that a revolution
might be taking place within the soul of that
tough woodsman.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be at all surprised," was what Elmer
told himself, as he later on watched Zack
devouring the supper George had prepared, "but
what this is going to turn out to be the making of
that man. He's surely seen a great light, and
already looks at things in a different way from
what he ever did before. And if I know Uncle
Caleb, as I think I do from having studied him,
the chances are ten to one he'll wait his chance,
and all he'll ask in return for what he's done will
be for Zack to get on the water wagon, and stay
there the rest of his life. Well, I hope it does
turn out that way. But who'd ever think we'd
run across such a wonderful object lesson away
off up here in the snow forest?"</p>

<p>And yet later on, when Elmer allowed himself
to survey the matter at closer range, he was not
greatly surprised; for he realized that occasions
are apt to spring up at the most unexpected times
when observing scouts can read a lesson in passing
events, if only they keep their wits about them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE QUEER ACTIONS OF ZACK ARNOLD</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Room</span> was found for the newcomer later on in
the half-circle before the fire, and though Zack
Arnold took no part in the conversation, he sat
there listening, and hearing things that must have
given him many new impressions. As a rule his
eyes were fastened upon the beaming and genial
face of Uncle Caleb, who, however, made out not
to notice this attention he was receiving, though
naturally he could not help knowing it.</p>

<p>The boys told their host numerous things connected
with the organization of the troop of Boy
Scouts in their town, and what wonderful things
it had already done for many of those who had
signed the muster roll. He was keenly interested,
and asked questions so fast that it kept them all
busy answering; for Elmer would never consent
that his chums simply sit there while he spoke for
all; he wished them to have a part in the telling.</p>

<p>On his part, Uncle Caleb related a lot about his
life in the past, touching upon some of the remarkable
things that had happened to him. Strange
as some of these might be reckoned, Elmer was
privately of the opinion that nothing more singular
could ever have happened to the traveler and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
scientist than the dramatic coming to his cabin
door on this bitter cold winter's night of one who
believed himself to be the old gentleman's enemy,
sorely wounded, almost ready to die, and wholly
dependant upon Uncle Caleb's bounty for his very
life.</p>

<p>When later on some of the scouts manifested
signs of drowsiness and exhaustion, by sundry
yawns and nods, the host declared it was time they
thought of getting some sleep.</p>

<p>"I'd put you on the cot here, Zack," he told
the guide, "only it isn't as strong as it might be,
and you're rather heavy. If it happened to give
way you'd get a bad wrench to that arm of yours
that wouldn't be very pleasant. So I'm going to
fix you out with a bunk on the floor near the fire.
I happen to have some spare blankets, and here
are some furs that will make things feel easy for
you. I don't suppose you object to sleeping on the
floor, do you?"</p>

<p>At that the man grinned, for the first time since
entering the cabin.</p>

<p>"Won't be the fust time by a thousand thet I've
slept on boards, suh," he went on to say, "an'
right hyar I wants to tell ye how much 'bleeged I
am ter yer fur all ye done by me. I don't deserve
a bit o' the same. I'm a bad man, suh, I been
thinkin' all manner o' rotten things 'bout ye, sence
ye guv me what I reckons I desarved, if ever a
mean skunk did; an' thet's what."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, Zack," said Uncle Caleb,
pleasantly; "I know you looked at things from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the wrong side, and at one time thought I'd done
you harm; but since then you've seen a better
light; and I wouldn't be surprised if you were
coming out of your way to my cabin to tell me so,
when this accident happened."</p>

<p>The big guide's jaws worked several times as
though he might be trying to say something; but
it was of no use, for not a word escaped him. He
did heave a deep sigh, however, and gave his kind
benefactor a long look before allowing his eyes to
drop.</p>

<p>Elmer felt satisfied, for he believed the cure
must be working. Indeed, he could not for the life
of him understand how any one could withstand
friendly advances from such a splendid old gentleman
as Uncle Caleb. His very eyes were full of
benevolence and the kindly spirit that filled his
heart. The man who would take the keenest delight
in binding up the broken leg of a poor little
rabbit that he found in distress, certainly could not
bear malice toward an uneducated woodsman, who
had never had half a chance to learn better things
than entertaining an unreasonable desire for revenge.</p>

<p>Under the direction of the owner of the cabin
Lil Artha made up a mighty comfortable bed on
the floor. When it was finished the scout tested
his work, and declared he would not mind sleeping
there all the rest of his stay, if Uncle Caleb
thought one of the bunks would be better for the
wounded guide.</p>

<p>Zack, however, would not hear of it. He declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that he preferred the floor for many reasons.
Lil Artha managed to shoot a suggestive
look toward Elmer, upon which the other shook his
head in the negative. He knew that the lengthy
scout suspected Zack might be thinking of taking
French leave while they slept, and perhaps help
himself to some of their stores in the bargain.
But Elmer had no such fear.</p>

<p>When the boys started to crawl into their respective
bunks, partly undressing, although none
of them had dreamed of bringing their pajamas
along on this wintry expedition, Zack appeared
to be asleep. At least he lay there bundled up, and
seemed to be breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Lil Artha, when he thought he was not noticed,
managed to deftly move his Marlin gun closer to
the bunk into which he meant to clamber presently.
He acted as if he more than half suspected he
might find occasion to make some sort of use of the
weapon before dawn broke again.</p>

<p>But Elmer had seen him; indeed, it was very
little that ever eluded those wideawake eyes of
the scout master, when out with his chums. He
managed to get a chance to whisper with Lil Artha
when the others were busily engaged making their
sleeping quarters ready.</p>

<p>"I'd be mighty slow to think of using that gun,
if I were you, Lil Artha," he suggested.</p>

<p>The lengthy scout flushed a little, and looked
somewhat confused.</p>

<p>"I might have known you'd glimpse me doin'
that same, Elmer," he confessed, "but when a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
wildcat comes down our chimney what's to hinder
its mate from doin' likewise? And if a fellow was
waked up in the night to find that a ferocious critter
had taken possession of our bungalow, why, a
gun'd be a good asset, believe me."</p>

<p>Elmer looked at him, and then smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, if that's what you've got troubling
you, it's all right, Lil Artha," he went on to say,
meaningly. "I kind of imagined you were thinking
of something else. And if some one should
take a notion to skip out, remember it's no business
of yours. We wouldn't want to detain any
one against his will."</p>

<p>"Sure, I didn't mean to try to," acknowledged
the tall scout, "'less, f'r instance, he tried to loot
the whole shebang, when I'd think it my duty to
cover him, and then call Uncle Caleb."</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll find any need of doing that,
Lil Artha," continued Elmer; "fact is, all the
signs point just the other way."</p>

<p>"Hope so," grunted his chum; and this was all
that passed between them.</p>

<p>Later on the cabin became quiet, except for the
heavy breathing of those who were sound asleep.
Elmer dozed. Somehow, although he was desperately
sleepy, he did not appear to be able to lose
himself for more than brief intervals at a stretch.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his strange surroundings, although
Elmer could hardly believe such to be the
case, for past experiences were against it. He
could remember sleeping soundly on more than
a few occasions when danger threatened; he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
helped guard the saddle band of horses on his
uncle's ranch when rustlers in the shape of horse
thieves were operating all through the vicinity;
and on being given a chance to snatch an hour's
sleep had lost himself as soon as his head touched
the ground.</p>

<p>The wind moaned through the branches of the
trees without. Now and then Elmer believed that
he could hear faint sounds that might proceed
from certain of the four-footed denizens of that
great snow forest around them, possibly searching
for food while the night lasted, since they
hugged their dens in the daytime.</p>

<p>Once he saw Lil Artha thrust his head out from
his bunk, and stare at the figure bundled up in
those blankets on the floor. This told the scout
master that Lil Artha had not been able to quite
get over the suspicions he had formed, and which
Elmer believed to be wholly unwarranted.</p>

<p>It must have been long after midnight when Elmer,
chancing to once more awaken, on glancing
out from his bunk saw that Zack Arnold was no
longer lying there on his well side, and wrapped
in sleep.</p>

<p>The revengeful guide was now sitting up. He
seemed to be intently listening, as though to either
discover whether all of the others were sound
asleep, or else trying to catch some signal from
without.</p>

<p>A dreadful thought flashed into Elmer's mind,
though he quickly dismissed it as unreasonable.
It was of course possible that Zack may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
coaxed others to accompany him on his mission of
revenge; but if he had company why should he
appeal to his bitter enemy when in desperate need
of succor? That alone stamped the idea as next
door to absurd; and so Elmer put it out of his mind
as impossible.</p>

<p>At the same time the actions of the guide were
certainly queer, to say the very least of it. He
was now getting slowly and painfully to his feet,
repressing a groan while so doing; because with
one arm tied up and useless it is not always the
easiest thing in the world to get up off the floor,
and out from a mess of clinging blankets.</p>

<p>Once he was on his feet the actions of the man
became even more suspicious. He crept toward
the door, turning his head several times as though
to make sure that no one was watching him. Here
he fumbled for a brief time, managing presently
to take aside the bar. Then he gently opened the
door, and as the wind was from the north, and the
opening faced the south, the cold air did not enter
when he had done this.</p>

<p>Elmer, still watching, half expected to see the
guide step out and depart. He was even debating
with himself as to whether his duty might not compel
him to raise his voice in protest against such
an act, since the chances were the man would not
be able to survive the exposure in his present
weakened condition, without his rifle, and with no
food to sustain him.</p>

<p>He saw that Lil Artha had that long neck of his
"rubbering," as he himself would have termed it;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
doubtless his gun was alongside him in the bunk,
and even then he had hold of it.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of Elmer, however, the man
did not pass beyond the doorsill. He seemed to
have drawn some object from a hidden receptacle
about his person, where it must have escaped observation
when his benefactors were helping him.
And giving this a swift toss Zack Arnold hurled
it far out amidst the snow drifts; after which he
backed into the cabin, softly closed the door,
glanced hurriedly around to see if he had been observed,
but seeing nothing, because Lil Artha had
hastily drawn his head back as might a cautious
old tortoise when threatened with peril; after
which the guide replaced the bar.</p>

<p>Five minutes after all this queer happening had
taken place Zack was once more bundled up in
his blankets, and apparently bound to go to sleep,
this time in real earnest.</p>

<p>After that Elmer seemed to find no difficulty
whatever in getting asleep himself. Why, it really
seemed as though a great load had been removed
from his mind; and the first thing he knew George
was calling him to get up, because breakfast was
almost ready.</p>

<p>It was a most unusual thing for the scout master
to over-sleep. Some of the others, notably Toby
and George, joked him about it; but Elmer noticed
that Lil Artha did not say a word.</p>

<p>Later on, after they had all partaken of the fine
meal that George prepared, he doing his level best
to show Uncle Caleb that there were other cooks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
as well, Elmer caught Lil Artha making certain
gestures in his direction. He could manage to
guess what it all meant, and believed the other
wanted a chance to talk with him outside.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the weather promises for to-day;
and I think I'll step out to see how things
look," Elmer presently remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>"I'll go along and give you the benefit of my
vast experience as a weather prophet!" exclaimed
Lil Artha, jumping up; "the rest of you stay inside,
because too many cooks spoil the broth, and
two of us ought to be enough to settle this job
with the clerk of the weather."</p>

<p>It happened that George was still busy with
some of his dishes, about which he saw Uncle Caleb
was unusually particular, in that he used two
separate waters in washing the same; while Toby
was busily employed in looking over some traps
he had discovered hanging from a nail, and evidently
seldom used; so that neither of them
dreamed of leaving the comfortable cabin, and
braving the outside air just then.</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Lil Artha?" demanded
the scout master, after the door had been carefully
closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Why, I happened to know that you saw that
ugly looking guide moving around in the middle
of the night, Elmer; and I thought you must have
noticed that he threw something away when he
was standing there in the doorway?"</p>

<p>"I did see him do that, and I knew you were
on the job, too, Lil Artha," Elmer went on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
say; "but if you've made a discovery, hurry up
and tell me what it is, because I haven't thought
to put my sweater on, and it's pretty chilly here."</p>

<p>"Well, I was that curious to know what it could
be the fellow threw away," continued the tall
scout, "the first thing this morning, before any
of the rest of you had peeped an eye open, I got
up, and came out here to look around."</p>

<p>"And did you find anything?" asked Elmer,
his own curiosity aroused by now.</p>

<p>"I had to go back and forth a heap before I
came on a little hole in a snow drift that looked
like something had dropped in there," continued
Lil Artha, in a highly mysterious fashion. "So
I began to dig down, and pretty soon my hand
touched this!"</p>

<p>He thereupon drew something from its place
of concealment, and held it up before the eyes
of his astonished companion.</p>

<p>"Why, it only looks like a piece of common
gaspipe!" exclaimed Elmer.</p>

<p>"Just what it is," Lil Artha went on, in an
awed tone; "but say, Elmer, the same is crowded
chock full of some sort of stuff that may be dynamite
for all I know. It's a sure-enough infernal
machine, one of the crude bombs that you read
about in the New York papers, such as Italians
use when they want to make some rich merchant
or banker hand over blackmail money. Look at
it yourself, and then you'll know what fetched
that skunk of a Zack Arnold up here to this region.
He meant to blow Uncle Caleb's cabin to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
flinders, that's what he did; and p'raps with the
owner inside of the same. Huh! no wonder he
didn't want that thing to be discovered on his
person! I sure don't blame him a little bit!"</p>

<p>And Elmer, as he examined the miserable contrivance
which would explode with so great a
power for harm, felt a thrill pass all over his
body.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A SCOUT'S EDUCATION</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">What</span> do you make of it, Elmer; is it a sure
enough bomb?" demanded Lil Artha, whose face
was working strangely under the violence of his
emotions.</p>

<p>"Looks like it was that, and nothing else," admitted
the scout master, slowly, with a wrinkle
across his forehead, as though he might be considering
weighty matters, as indeed he was just
then, for one so young.</p>

<p>"And there can't be any doubt but what he
meant to blow up the cabin of the man he forced
himself to believe was his enemy, the kindest-hearted
gentleman you and the rest of us ever
met up with&mdash;tell me that, Elmer, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Lil Artha, don't explode!" cautioned
Elmer, soothingly. "I understand how
you feel about this ugly business. Yes, that must
have been the scheme that brought Zack away
up here in the dead of winter. Whether he
meant to do Uncle Caleb bodily injury or not
we've no means of knowing. Let's hope that the
limit of his revenge was confined to the destruction
of the cabin, and all the valued treasures it
held."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that would be arson, and the law sits
down mighty hard on anybody who deliberately,
and 'with malice aforethought,' as I've heard my
dad say, sets fire to the property of another. He
deserves being kicked out, and we'll have to attend
to his case, the whole bunch of us."</p>

<p>The excited scout made a quick movement, as
though about to rush into the cabin, waving the
piece of gas-pipe which had been fashioned into
a rude but deadly bomb with a fuse to it; Elmer,
however, tightened his grip on his chum's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Wait! Don't be in such a hurry, old fellow.
Let's reason this thing out a little before you
spill the fat in the fire!" he told Lil Artha, in
that quieting voice of his that carried such weight
with the other scouts.</p>

<p>"But, Elmer, don't you see he's a regular firebrand!"
urged the tall boy, twisting a little, as
though struggling to get loose from the detaining
hand; but only in a faint-hearted fashion, because
as always the influence of the scout master
predominated. "How do we know but what
right now he's figuring on doing us all some mean
trick? We're friends of Uncle Caleb, and he
must look on us as his enemies."</p>

<p>"You forget something, Lil Artha," urged
Elmer.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, in my hurry I'm always forgetting
things; but tell me what I've let slip now, Elmer."</p>

<p>"It was yesterday that Zack was heading toward
this cabin, breathing all sorts of ugly
threats against Uncle Caleb, wasn't it?" Elmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
continued, in that smooth argumentative tone he
knew how to use so well, and which as a rule was
so wonderfully convincing.</p>

<p>"Why, of course it was, Elmer," admitted the
other, weakly, yet curiously.</p>

<p>"And something has happened since then, you
know, Lil Artha?"</p>

<p>"Oh! sure, several things," replied the tall
scout.</p>

<p>"Zack Arnold had an accident, and found himself
facing what might be the end of his evil
career," continued Elmer. "Now, life is sweet
even to such a man; and he couldn't but feel
alarmed at the idea of being frozen in the snow
forest, because of his broken arm, and having no
way to supply himself with food or fire. Then in
his desperation he forgot everything else, and
came to the cabin of the man he had been calling
his enemy. You know what sort of a reception
he got, Lil Artha?"</p>

<p>"You bet I do, Elmer; it couldn't have been
warmer if he'd been a life-long comrade of Uncle
Caleb!"</p>

<p>"All right, then," the scout master told him,
emphatically; "and you can depend on it Zack
has had an experience unlike anything he ever ran
up against before. I've been watching him, and
trying to figure out what might be passing
through his brain; and the fact of his throwing
this bomb as far away as he could shows that he's
heartily ashamed of ever entertaining the notion
that Uncle Caleb was an enemy of his."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really think so, Elmer? And could
such a scoundrel ever reform?" asked Lil Artha,
half skeptically, just as though he were Doubting
George.</p>

<p>"Of course I wouldn't like to stake my reputation
on it," Elmer continued; "but all the signs
point that way. The man is just now in a daze.
He never met with anything like this before, and
hardly knows what to make of it. In other words,
Lil Artha, he has arrived at the cross-roads, and
the next few days will either see him turning over
a new leaf, or going back to his old ways again.
It must depend pretty much on Uncle Caleb."</p>

<p>"I reckon it will, Elmer!" muttered the tall
scout, beginning to drift across the line, and agree
with what the other advanced. "And don't you
think we ought to let Uncle Caleb know about this
gas-pipe thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't think it'll make any difference
with his way of treating the man. Uncle
Caleb has sized Zack up to a dot, and he's trying
to get the whip-hand over him by sheer kindness.
And I think he will, sooner or later. It
wouldn't surprise me if it all ended in Zack
turning right-about face, and caring for Uncle
Caleb just as much as he thought he hated him.
Such men when they do change never make a half-way
job of it; they go the whole thing."</p>

<p>"Shall I call Uncle Caleb out here now while
we're at it, Elmer?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it, and you wait here," the scout master
told him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, then; you know how to go about it
better than I do. I'll be ready to spring my little
surprise on our host," said Lil Artha.</p>

<p>So Elmer stepped over, and opening the door
quietly, caught the eye of Uncle Caleb, when he
crooked his finger. The meaning of this gesture
could not well be mistaken, and presently the old
scientist joined them outside the cabin, making
some excuse as he passed out.</p>

<p>When Lil Artha showed him the queer piece of
gas-pipe that had been charged with some high
explosive apt to carry great destruction with it
when discharged, Uncle Caleb did not appear to
be greatly astonished.</p>

<p>"I imagined it might turn out to be something
of the sort, boys," he informed the scouts; "and
it was my full intention to look around later on,
so as to discover what it was Zack threw away
last night; for I saw him standing there in the
doorway just as both of you seem to have done.
You've saved me the trouble of making the
search, Lil Artha. But let me hide this ugly
thing. I wouldn't like Zack to know it had been
found so soon."</p>

<p>"Then you won't turn him out for coming up
here on such a terrible errand?" asked Lil Artha,
weakly.</p>

<p>Uncle Caleb looked at him, and smiled. Lil Artha
understood then what was in the mind of the
kindly scientist, who loved his fellow men so well
that he could even believe the worst of them must
have <i>some</i> good in him, however small, if only one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
could discover its location, and coax the wavering
spark to glow into a steady flame.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Zack ever had a chance," he
told them, seriously, "and I'm going to give him
one right now, if it's in my power. As scouts,
neither of you would surely deny it to him, I'm
certain. Besides, it's going to give me considerable
pleasure in studying the working of the germ
that has been planted in his heart by this piece
of good luck. Perhaps that broken arm may
mean everything to Zack Arnold. A year from
now we'll take stock, and see how things come out.
In the meantime say nothing, and leave it all to
your Uncle Caleb."</p>

<p>Willingly both boys declared that they were
only too glad to do so. They asked, and readily received
permission, to tell George and Toby, when
a chance came. And as they entered the cabin
later on, to see Zack still following Uncle Caleb
with his wondering, yes, even admiring glance,
it struck the scouts that perhaps the sensible old
scientist had made a study of human nature as
he had the habits of wild animals, and knew full
well what he was doing.</p>

<p>During the balance of that day he treated the
wounded man just as though the intruder might
be one of the family. Uncle Caleb was too wise
to gush over the injured guide; he simply showed
Zack that he had a deep interest in his welfare,
and meant that he should have every care while
unable to look out for himself that could be expended
on him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Elmer, who was observing these things closely,
without betraying the fact that he had more than
a passing interest in them, told himself that it
would not be surprising if when they came to
leave the cabin in the forest a pact had been arranged
between Uncle Caleb and Zack Arnold,
by means of which the big guide was to stay up
there the balance of the winter, and act as a side
partner to the man he had once been so foolish
as to consider his enemy.</p>

<p>"There'll be no chance for him to hobnob with
his real enemy, which you can take it from me is
strong drink," the scout master told the other
boys when they talked matters over, away from
the cabin that afternoon; "and before spring
comes, I wouldn't be surprised if Uncle Caleb has
weaned him from his old habits, so that nothing
can ever tempt him to go back to them again."</p>

<p>"I hope you're right, Elmer," ventured
George; "I don't feel quite as strong as you do
about it, because I just can't, that's what; but
it'd be splendid if Uncle Caleb did reform that
beast."</p>

<p>"And I think it's just wonderful," Toby admitted,
having heard the whole story with great
eagerness and interest; "I never knew Uncle
Caleb was such a splendid sort of a man. And
honest now, I don't see how any fellow could hold
out against his winning ways. No wonder Zack
keeps watching him all the time; I tell you he's
as near hypnotized as anybody could be."</p>

<p>And so they concluded to let the matter rest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
confident that the good man of the lonely cabin in
the snow forest knew what he was doing, and that
the chances were he was not making any mistake.</p>

<p>The boys now proceeded to enjoy themselves to
the best of their ability, each according to his
bent. Of course all of them were keenly interested
in the remarkable success with which the
scientist was meeting in his effort to secure amusing
and instructive flashlight pictures of the
woods animals at night. He showed them how
he set his snares, so cleverly arranged that when
the fox or the mink came to take the tempting bait
that had been cunningly placed, he was compelled
to pull a cord that released the hammer by which
the fulminating cap was detonated, and the flashlight
cartridge set going, thus causing the little
animal to take his own picture.</p>

<p>That very night every one of the four scouts
accompanied Uncle Caleb to set several of these
ingenious traps. The novel experience appealed
to all of them; and even Lil Artha, usually an ardent
hunter, was heard to admit that it afforded
all the excitement necessary for enjoyment, anticipation
and realization combined, without having
to destroy the life of the cunning little creatures
that, in roaming the woods, and seeking
their natural food supplies, were only working
out their individual destinies.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," Lil Artha confided to Elmer, later
on, when they were returning to the warm cabin
where Zack had been left in full charge, "I don't
believe I'd like to become a regular fur trapper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
though once on a time I did seem to hanker after
such a life. It's all well enough to shoot game
when you're hungry, just like you'd knock over a
chicken when the dominie is coming to dinner;
but this thing of trapping little things like mink
and muskrats just for the money their skins bring
in the market doesn't strike me as quite right.
I'd never see a lady wearing a fur coat again
without feeling queer, like all the innocent little
animals I'd gone and slaughtered were parading
before me. Nixey for mine, I give you my
word."</p>

<p>Elmer did not make any reply in words, but the
satisfied glance he gave the speaker was eloquent
enough. Truth to tell he was well pleased with
the change that was working in Lil Artha. At
one time the tall scout had shown signs of becoming
so infatuated with hunting that quite a savage
desire to slay things had begun to manifest itself
in his disposition. Already had the mild influence
of Uncle Caleb begun to make itself felt.</p>

<p>Zack Arnold would not be the only one benefitted
by contact with the owner of the cabin.
Some of the scouts would return home with new
ideas concerning things. Already Elmer could
see where this midwinter holiday trip was going
to repay them a dozen-fold for all it cost. He
was satisfied with the promising results, and
would not have had things different, could the
choice be his for the taking.</p>

<p>While they were gone Zack had tidied up the
cabin after a rude fashion, considering that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
did not know much about keeping things looking
nice in the first place, and had only one arm to
work with in the second. But it was the fact that
he was beginning to take a decided interest in
things that pleased Uncle Caleb, who was not slow
to commend his thoughtfulness, and Elmer could
see the glow that flashed into the eyes of the big
guide, telling that he had already begun to desire
to do that which would commend itself to his
kind benefactor.</p>

<p>"And it's going to be all right," Elmer told
himself, as he lay down later in his bunk, watching
the two men who were still sitting by the fire,
talking about the habits of animals, for Zack
having been a guide all his life was brimfull of
such lore; "he's got Zack going, and nothing can
stop him now. It must give a fellow a mighty
nice feeling to know that he's changed such a life,
and for better things. But if we only knew all
that has happened in Uncle Caleb's past I reckon
we'd find that this is just one little incident in a
long string."</p>

<p>And that night neither Elmer nor Lil Artha
dreamed of keeping watch because of the presence
of so desperate a character as Zack Arnold
under the same roof that sheltered them. Indeed,
so greatly had their opinions changed that
they would have been willing to put considerable
trust in the loyalty of the rough guide. His very
face did not seem one-half so repulsive, now that
it no longer showed the marks of passion and
pain. In fact, Elmer could see where in good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
time Zack might turn out to be a pretty fair looking
sort of a man; for once when he allowed a
smile to cross his face he was rather attractive.</p>

<p>So the night wore away, and another day
dawned. The boys, knowing that their vacation
was moving swiftly along, and feeling that they
must crowd everything possible into the few remaining
days, had laid out a plan of campaign
that would make this a busy period. And Uncle
Caleb was ready to join them in any undertaking
that had for its object the satisfying of their desire
for rollicking fun, or their education along
the line of a more intimate acquaintance with the
little woods folks in whom he took such a decided
interest.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>GOOD-BY TO THE SNOW FOREST</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened that very afternoon Lil Artha met
with an adventure that stirred his red blood at
quite a lively rate, and for a little time caused
quite a lively excitement around the vicinity of
the cabin.</p>

<p>Elmer, Toby and George had gone off with
Uncle Caleb to investigate some freak of Nature
in which the old scientist was interested. Lil
Artha at the time was suffering from a chafed
heel, and thought the long walk through the deep
snow was more than he cared to undertake; so
he had promised to remain home and look after
preparations for supper.</p>

<p>As it was too early to think of commencing that
job, he had wandered forth for a little stroll, not
meaning to go far away from the cabin. Of
course such a thing as danger never once appealed
to the boy; and with those new thoughts
concerning hunting and destroying animal life in
possession of his mind, he certainly was not going
to shoulder his shotgun, which he had left in a
corner of the cabin.</p>

<p>In the midst of his wandering he suddenly
heard a strange scratching sound that gave him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thrill. Looking up in the quarter from which it
seemed to come, Lil Artha was astonished to see
a pair of yellow eyes glaring down at him, and
recognize the gray coat of a ferocious wildcat.</p>

<p>He instantly jumped at the conclusion that this
must be the mate of the animal they had killed
after it had forced an entrance into the cabin, to
steal Uncle Caleb's smoked meat, and then savagely
attacked them. Yes, there could be no doubt
about it; and the cat was evidently of a mind to
spring upon him, and through means of its terrible
claws seek to have revenge for the loss of its
mate. Some feline instinct doubtless told the
beast that this boy must have been concerned in
the death of the partner of its joys and sorrows,
which we happen to know was the actual truth.</p>

<p>Lil Artha's first thought was to turn and sprint
for the safety of the cabin as fast as he could go.
Then it struck him as a dangerous thing to turn
his back on such a treacherous foe as a wildcat;
for there could be no question but what the animal
would immediately make its leap, and land on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>Lil Artha realized that the best thing for him
to do was to keep his face turned toward his four-footed
enemy. If only now he could pick up a
suitable cudgel he might be able to give a decent
account of himself; but to struggle with that terror
of the snow forest, with only his bare hands,
did not please him at all.</p>

<p>He shot a hasty glance all around him. The
snow happened to have blown away in that particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
spot, where one of the boys had been chopping
fuel; and there Lil Artha discovered just the
sort of stick he believed he could wield to good
advantage in keeping his feline foe at bay.</p>

<p>Giving a wild shout, in hopes of alarming the
beast more or less, he sprang toward the coveted
trophy, with outstretched hand. And when his
eager fingers closed about the end of the three-foot
club Lil Artha felt considerably better.</p>

<p>It appeared, though, that his work was cut out
for him. The cat actually leaped directly for
him, and never would the boy forget how terrible
the sight of that flying figure passing through
space appeared to his excited mind.</p>

<p>By a nimble jump to one side Lil Artha managed
to avoid contact with the extended claws of
the cat; and the disappointed animal, upon landing
in a heap, instantly whirled around and again
sprang toward him. This time the boy struck
with his club, and managed to knock his assailant
over, though the now thoroughly aroused animal
seemed more determined to get at him than ever.</p>

<p>So the battle raged, Lil Artha all the while
shouting at the top of his lungs, though he hardly
knew what for, since his chums and Uncle Caleb
were more than a mile distant, and could hardly
hear him at best.</p>

<p>He fought with all the dexterity he could command.
When he struck at the raging beast he
knew that should he manage to make a miss nothing
could keep him from having the cat fasten itself
on his breast, tearing and biting with fury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Time and again did he bring that good club
against the hairy form of his enemy, and send the
wildcat bowling over; but it surely had the nine
lives such tough animals are usually credited with,
for on every occasion it managed to once more
regain its feet, and crippled as it may have been
come stubbornly straight at him again.</p>

<p>Lil Artha was getting winded, just as he might
have been after knocking a dozen tremendous
fouls, when playing in a hotly contested game of
baseball. He felt a cold chill pass over him as he
began to wonder whether he might not be tired
out by this beast that seemed never to know when
to give in; and what might not happen then?</p>

<p>Once more he had brought his stick against the
creeping cat with such good will that the animal
was knocked fully six feet away; but to his despair
it immediately recovered, and started back
toward him.</p>

<p>Just then Lil Artha heard a loud report, and
saw the cat roll over in a heap. As the relieved
scout looked in the direction from whence that
shot had come he saw Zack Arnold standing
there, his face drawn and white with pain; for in
handling Lil Artha's gun so as to relieve the boy
of his fierce antagonist he must have given his
broken arm a severe wrench, that for the moment
made him feel sick and faint.</p>

<p>And Lil Artha, seeing how things were, threw
an arm about the big guide, weak by reason of his
pain, and helped him back to the cabin. After
that Lil Artha forgot that he had expressed any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
doubt concerning the reformation of Zack Arnold.
The guide had proved his change of heart
by that action; and it would serve to cement the
bonds of the new friendship that had sprung up
between him and Uncle Caleb, as well as the old
scientist's boyish guests.</p>

<p>Later on, when the others returned from their
trip, the boys full of the interesting things they
had seen, great was their surprise to hear how Lil
Artha had been concerned in a stirring adventure.
The report of the gun had been wafted to their
ears, but of course they expected that it was only
Lil Artha doing a little hunting on his private
account near the cabin, though Uncle Caleb did
not fancy the boy taking any such liberties with
his familiar four-footed friends.</p>

<p>They all had to go out and examine the body of
the dead wildcat, remarking that if anything it
surpassed its mate in the way of ferocity, and
blind recklessness, in attacking a human being
without any particular provocation, and in broad
daylight at that.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it had to be," remarked Uncle Caleb,
with a sigh, "for I expected to have considerable
enjoyment later on in trying to get these cats
to play photographer for themselves; but no one
is to blame in either instance. If attacked by
such a fierce creature I myself would shoot to kill
without any hesitation. After its mate was destroyed
I suppose this one would never have given
me any peace. And at any rate it afforded Zack
a chance to prove that he was not ungrateful;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
which after all is the best part of the whole affair,
barring your escape from being clawed, Lil Artha.
Are you sure the claws or teeth of the cat didn't
scratch you the least bit, because in that case I'd
want to take due precautions. Blood poisoning
might set in if the cuts were neglected, all depending
on the condition of your own blood."</p>

<p>The tall scout had examined his hands and face
thoroughly before the others of the party returned
home, for he was not wholly ignorant concerning
the possible results that sometimes follow
wounds received through carnivorous animals.
He knew that Elmer always made it a practice to
carry with him a small phial of permanganate of
potassium, to be freely used as a wash in such
cases, as calculated to cleanse the wound of all
foreign matter, and neutralize any poison that
might come from contact with claws impregnated
with it.</p>

<p>He assured the anxious woodsman that he had
escaped even the slightest scratch, and could consider
himself especially fortunate, in which the
other heartily agreed with him.</p>

<p>Again did they spend another happy evening
around the cheery fire. As the flames glowed and
crackled they coaxed Uncle Caleb to tell more incidents
connected with his explorations in faraway
Thibet, when he was the first white man to
enter the Forbidden City and interview the Head
Llama, whose existence had up to that time been
pretty much of a sealed mystery to the civilized
world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Another peaceful night followed, and then came
dawn again. This was to be their nest to last
day in the snow forest, because on the second
morning they must prepare to turn their faces
toward home again, seek the little station, signal
to a passing train, and be carried back to familiar
scenes.</p>

<p>In many ways all of them would be sorry when
the time for separation arrived; and so they had
planned to do divers things during these two
days, which it was sincerely hoped would turn out
pleasant ones. The weather had moderated, and
even a thaw set in late the preceding day, but as
the wind whipped around once more into the
northwest the surface of the snow became covered
with a sheet of ice that was almost thick enough
to bear the weight of a small boy.</p>

<p>Toby was wild with eagerness to be shown how
to use those wonderful snow-shoes which Uncle
Caleb had given him for a present; and so the old
woodsman showed him just how to attach them to
his toes, so as to leave the balance of the foot free
to bend at his will, though really Elmer had explained
this thing to Toby before.</p>

<p>Under the guiding care of first Uncle Caleb, and
when he grew tired, of Elmer on the old scientist's
snow-shoes, Toby was enabled to perform
quite creditably, and in the end felt that he knew
fairly well how to spin over the ice-crusted drifts
in a way that would hardly have shamed those
Canadian cousins of his who belonged to the famous
Teuque Bleue Snow-shoe Club up in Montreal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and wrote him such glowing accounts of the
long trips they took over Mount Royal, and into
the bush, in the dead of winter.</p>

<p>The boys had not forgotten how they had been
almost reduced to a diet of musquash at the time
Lil Artha so fortunately shot his deer; and upon
invitation from Elmer, who was genuinely desirous
of learning whether the dish could be as palatable
as some hunters and Indians declared,
Uncle Caleb told them they could get a number of
the little animals with the glossy fur, and he himself
promised to prepare the stew.</p>

<p>Well, they ate it, and George even came in for
a second helping, but on the whole it was the consensus
of opinion that they did not really hanker
after "musquash," which might please some palates,
and serve as a means to ward off actual
starvation, but did not seem to appeal to them
very strongly. All of which was fortunate indeed
for the furry denizens of the marsh, because there
would be no further loud calls for a repetition of
the dish.</p>

<p>The last day was pretty much taken up with
seeing all they could of Uncle Caleb and trying
to grasp the results of his labors in the cause of
science and natural history. Each of the boys
was given a sheaf of prints to carry back with
him, many of them most interesting revelations
concerning the hidden lives of the four-footed
neighbors of Uncle Caleb, whose habits were so
little known to the average person. And even
George admitted that he would not have missed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
what he had learned while up in the great snow
forest, with this observing relative of Toby for a
good deal. It had broadened his knowledge of
many things, and given him a much higher estimate
of human nature in seeing how kindness had
won the game over an evil desire for revenge.</p>

<p>It was all settled, and Zack Arnold was going
to stay there as the side partner of Uncle Caleb.
He did not appear like the same man when on that
last morning he shook each one of the four scouts
by the hand and hoped he would see them again.
There was a look on his face that surprised
George and Lil Artha, who at one time had expressed
themselves so strongly to the effect that
they did not believe any good could ever come out
of so tough a customer.</p>

<p>"I'll never say that again, as long as I live!"
George admitted, later on; "after this I'm going
to look for the spark of good in every hard case,
instead of only seeing the evil."</p>

<p>"I sure have had a lesson I'll never forget,"
added Lil Artha; "and when you get right down
to facts that Zack Arnold isn't such a bad fellow
either. What he don't know about the woods you
could put in a thimble; and I can see that after
Uncle Caleb has had him with him six months he's
going to turn out something more than half-way
decent."</p>

<p>Fortunately they did not meet with another
snow storm while on the homeward road but on
arriving at the little station they had only to await
the train. The same little urchin from whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
they had received the false information grinned
at them. Lil Artha was for giving him the drubbing
he richly deserved; but Elmer counselled differently.</p>

<p>"After all it was a lucky thing he gave us the
wrong directions," he told the other scouts.
"We have had a whole lot of experiences that
would never have come to us otherwise. And
then you shot that fine young buck, remember,
Lil Artha. So, taking pattern from Uncle Caleb,
suppose we wash the incident from the slate."</p>

<p>And what did Lil Artha do but approach the
grinning urchin, and actually thank him for the
trouble he had taken to direct them, stating that
they had had the "time of their lives," and tossing
him a silver quarter as a reward for his being
so solicitous about their welfare. The last thing
they saw as the train carried them away was that
country boy standing there, staring at the coin he
held in one hand while he scratched his head in
perplexity and evidently wondered what it all
meant. So Lil Artha had taken a page from the
diary of Uncle Caleb, and applied the kind-hearted
old scientist's methods to his own case.</p>

<p>The four scouts reached home in safety, and
with plenty to interest those of their comrades of
the troop who had not been along. It is to be
hoped that at some not far distant day in the future
we may be permitted to chronicle still further
of the happenings that came the way of Elmer,
Toby, Lil Artha, George, and others belonging to
the Hickory Ridge Troop of Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>A book which treats, in a most practical and fascinating manner
all subjects pertaining to the "King of Trades"; showing the care
and use of tools; drawing; designing, and the laying out of work;
the principles involved in the building of various kinds of structures,
and the rudiments of architecture. It contains over two

includes also a complete glossary of the technical terms used in the

applying the work in the successive stages. It shows how the

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL</a>
